# Teach Charlie AI: Content & SEO Strategy

## A Launch Playbook Section for a Solo Founder

---

## Executive Summary

This strategy is designed for a solo, non-technical founder with approximately 20 hours per week of non-technical work capacity and a total budget of $100-$500/month. The core insight driving every recommendation below: **you cannot outproduce OpenAI, Botpress, or Voiceflow on content volume. You win by being the most relatable, accessible, and education-focused voice in a space that talks over its audience's head.**

The entire strategy is built around one principle: **Workshop-First Content.** Every piece of content should either come from a workshop, lead to a workshop, or simulate the workshop experience. This is your unfair advantage — you actually teach people face-to-face, and that lived experience produces content that no AI-content-farm competitor can replicate.

**Projected timeline to meaningful organic traffic**: 6-9 months for long-tail keywords, 12-18 months for moderate-volume terms. Content compounds. The first 3 months will feel like shouting into the void. That is normal.

**Recommended content budget allocation** (within $100-$500/mo total):
- SEO tools: $0-$50/mo (free tiers first, upgrade when traffic justifies it)
- Video production: $0-$30/mo (Descript free tier, Canva free tier)
- Content assistance: $0-$100/mo (Claude/ChatGPT for drafts you heavily edit with your voice)
- Everything else goes to ads, hosting, and tools from other playbook sections

## 1. Content Pillars & Topic Clusters

### Pillar Architecture

You need exactly **5 content pillars**. Each pillar maps to a core audience pain point and has a dedicated "pillar page" (a comprehensive 3,000+ word guide) with 10-15 "cluster articles" (800-1,500 words each) that link back to it. This hub-and-spoke model is how small sites build topical authority that Google rewards.

**Why 5 pillars, not more?** A solo founder producing 2-3 articles per month needs focus. Five pillars give you enough breadth to capture different search intents while keeping the site topically coherent.

---

### Content Production Calendar (First 6 Months)

At 2-3 articles per month, here is the recommended sequence. The logic: start with comparison and high-intent articles (they convert), then build out educational content (it ranks over time).

| Month | Article 1 | Article 2 | Article 3 (if time) |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **1** | P3-1: Teach Charlie vs ChatGPT GPTs | P2-2: Automating Your FAQ | P1-3: I'm Not Technical — Can I Build an AI Agent? |
| **2** | P3-4: 7 Best No-Code AI Agent Builders | P2-12: Train AI on Business Data | P1-1: What Is an AI Agent? |
| **3** | P3-8: Best AI Chatbot for Small Business | P5-3: Embedding AI on Your Website | P4-5: Learning AI Doesn't Mean Learning to Code |
| **4** | P1-5: 12 Real AI Agent Examples | P2-8: Make AI Sound Like Your Brand | P4-1: What Happens at an AI Workshop? |
| **5** | P3-7: Custom GPTs vs AI Agent Builders | P5-2: AI Lead Qualification | P1-10: Prompt Writing for Normal People |
| **6** | P2-7: 5 AI Agents for Service Businesses | P5-7: How to Measure AI Agent ROI | P4-7: Workshop Recap: [City] |

**Why this order**: Months 1-2 prioritize comparison content (captures people actively evaluating tools) and high-intent how-to content (captures people ready to act). Months 3-4 broaden the funnel. Months 5-6 deepen topical authority.

---

## 2. YouTube Strategy

### The Honest Assessment

YouTube is extremely high-effort for a solo founder. A single "good" video takes 4-8 hours (scripting, recording, editing, thumbnail, upload optimization). At 20 hours/week of non-technical time, that is 20-40% of your available time for one video.

**Recommendation: Do NOT start a regular YouTube cadence until Month 4-6, after you have validated demand through workshops and have at least 10 published blog articles driving organic traffic.** The exception: record every workshop from Day 1 and publish lightly edited versions. This is nearly free content.

### When to Start and What to Prioritize

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Workshop Recordings Only**
- Record every workshop with screen capture + room audio
- Upload with minimal editing (just trim start/end, add intro card)
- Time investment: 1-2 hours per workshop recording (uploading + basic metadata)
- This builds a library of authentic, long-form content

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Add 2 Videos Per Month**
- One tutorial/walkthrough per month (screen recording + voiceover)
- One "watch me build" per month (screen recording, talking through decisions)
- Time investment: 6-10 hours per month total

**Phase 3 (Months 7+): Scale to Weekly If Metrics Justify**
- Only increase frequency if videos from Phase 2 show traction (>500 views average)
- Add comparison videos and reaction/commentary content
- Consider hiring a video editor ($200-400/month on Fiverr or Upwork)

### Video Formats Ranked by ROI for a Solo Founder

1. **Workshop recordings** (highest ROI — content you already produce)
2. **Screen recording tutorials** ("How to build X in 15 minutes") — high search value, easy to produce
3. **"Watch me build" walkthroughs** — authentic, shows the product in action, builds trust
4. **Comparison reviews** ("Teach Charlie vs ChatGPT GPTs") — captures high-intent search traffic
5. **Talking head explainers** — lowest priority; requires more production skill and comfort on camera

### Production Setup (Minimal Budget)

| Tool | Purpose | Cost | Notes |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| **OBS Studio** | Screen recording | Free | Record screen + webcam simultaneously |
| **Descript** | Editing, transcription, filler word removal | Free tier (10 hrs/mo) | Best solo-founder editing tool; edit video like a document |
| **Canva** | Thumbnails, intro/outro cards | Free tier | YouTube thumbnail templates available |
| **Loom** (alternative) | Quick screen recordings | Free tier (25 videos) | Easier than OBS for simple tutorials |
| **Rode USB-C Mini** or **Blue Yeti** | Audio quality | $60-$130 one-time | Audio quality matters more than video quality |

**Total ongoing cost: $0-$30/month** (Descript paid tier only needed after exceeding free hours)

### YouTube SEO Basics for AI Content

**Titles**: Front-load the keyword. Use numbers. Signal simplicity.
- Good: "Build an AI Agent in 15 Minutes — No Coding Required"
- Bad: "Teach Charlie AI Platform Tutorial and Review"

**Descriptions**: First 2 lines appear in search results. Include:
- Line 1: Benefit statement with primary keyword
- Line 2: Call to action (link to free trial)
- Lines 3-10: Detailed description with secondary keywords
- Bottom: Links to related videos, social media, timestamps

**Tags** (still marginally useful): Include exact match keyword + variations + competitor names
- Example for a comparison video: "teach charlie ai", "chatgpt custom gpts", "ai agent builder", "no code ai", "ai chatbot for business", "botpress alternative"

**Thumbnails**: The single biggest factor in click-through rate.
- Use bold text (3-5 words max)
- Show before/after or a surprising result
- Use contrasting colors (yellow text on dark background performs well in tech)
- Include your face if you are comfortable on camera (builds trust)
- Use Canva's YouTube thumbnail templates as a starting point

**Chapters/Timestamps**: Always add manual timestamps. Google uses these for search features.

## 3. SEO Keyword Strategy

### The Competitive Reality

Let me be blunt: you will not rank for "AI chatbot" (volume: 50K+, difficulty: 95/100) or "AI agent" (volume: 30K+, difficulty: 90/100) in 2026. These terms are dominated by OpenAI, Google, IBM, and venture-backed companies with dedicated SEO teams and domains with 90+ Domain Authority.

Your strategy must be: **own the long tail, dominate niche intersections, and build topical authority in the "non-technical AI user" space that the big players ignore.**

### Keyword Categories (with specific examples)

#### Category A: Long-Tail "How To" Keywords (Easiest to Rank)
These are your bread and butter. Low volume individually, but they compound and they convert.

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Priority |
|---------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| "how to build an AI agent without coding" | 200-500 | Low | Very High |
| "how to automate customer support without coding" | 200-500 | Low | Very High |
| "how to create an AI chatbot for my small business" | 500-1K | Medium | High |
| "how to train AI on my business data" | 200-500 | Low-Medium | Very High |
| "how to embed AI chat on website no code" | 100-200 | Low | High |
| "how to make AI chatbot sound natural" | 200-500 | Low | Medium |
| "how to build AI FAQ bot" | 200-500 | Low | High |
| "how to use AI for small business customer service" | 200-500 | Low-Medium | High |
| "how to teach AI about my company" | 100-200 | Low | Very High |
| "how to set up AI lead qualification" | 100-200 | Low | Medium |

**Why these matter**: Someone searching "how to build an AI agent without coding" is your exact target user, actively looking for a solution. Even at 200 monthly searches, a 5% click-through rate at a 3% conversion rate generates steady signups.

#### Category B: "Best/Top" Listicle Keywords (Medium Difficulty)

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Priority |
|---------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| "best no-code AI agent builder" | 500-1K | Medium | Very High |
| "best AI chatbot for small business" | 1K-5K | Medium-High | High |
| "best AI chatbot builder for beginners" | 200-500 | Medium | High |
| "best alternatives to ChatGPT for business" | 1K-5K | High | Medium |
| "best AI tools for non-technical people" | 200-500 | Low-Medium | High |
| "best AI agent builder 2026" | 500-1K | Medium | High |
| "best AI platforms for small business owners" | 200-500 | Medium | Medium |
| "top AI chatbot builders under $50" | 100-200 | Low | High |

**Why these matter**: "Best X" keywords have extremely high commercial intent. The searcher is ready to buy — they just need to pick which tool.

#### Category C: Problem-Aware Keywords (High Conversion)

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Priority |
|---------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| "automate customer questions AI" | 100-200 | Low | Very High |
| "AI chatbot that learns from my documents" | 200-500 | Low-Medium | Very High |
| "create FAQ bot for website" | 500-1K | Medium | High |
| "AI assistant for booking appointments" | 200-500 | Medium | Medium |
| "make AI respond like my brand" | 100-200 | Low | High |
| "AI agent to handle leads while I sleep" | 50-100 | Very Low | Medium |
| "reduce customer support time with AI" | 100-200 | Low | Medium |
| "no code chatbot builder for website" | 500-1K | Medium | High |

**Why these matter**: These people have a problem and are looking for a solution — they have not yet decided what category of tool they need. You can introduce them to the concept of AI agents through their specific pain point.

#### Category D: Competitor Brand Keywords (Handle with Care)

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| "Botpress alternative" | 500-1K | Medium | Good target — Botpress is technical |
| "Voiceflow alternative" | 200-500 | Medium | Good target — Voiceflow is complex |
| "ChatGPT GPTs for business" | 1K-5K | High | Write comparison, not "alternative" |
| "Chatbase alternative" | 200-500 | Medium | Similar audience to yours |
| "Crisp chat alternative" | 200-500 | Medium | Different category but overlapping users |
| "Langflow tutorial" | 200-500 | Low | You literally run on Langflow — own this |
| "Zapier AI chatbot" | 200-500 | Medium | Differentiate: Zapier automates workflows, you build agents |

**Important**: Do NOT create comparison pages for every competitor. Focus on the 4-5 where you have a genuine differentiation story. Skip competitors that serve a fundamentally different audience (e.g., enterprise-only platforms like IBM Watson).

#### Category E: Local SEO Keywords (If Workshops Are a Channel)

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| "AI workshop [your city]" | 50-200 | Very Low | Create a page for every city you present in |
| "learn AI [your city]" | 100-500 | Low | City-specific landing pages |
| "AI training for businesses [your city]" | 50-100 | Very Low | Hyper-local, low competition |
| "small business AI meetup [your city]" | 0-50 | Very Low | May not have volume yet — own it early |

**Why this matters**: Local SEO is dramatically less competitive. If you run workshops in 3-4 cities, create a landing page for each with unique content (workshop recap, photos, testimonials from attendees). These pages can rank within weeks, not months.

**Implementation**: Create a Google Business Profile if you have any physical presence. Add "AI Workshop" and "AI Training" to your business categories. Encourage workshop attendees to leave Google reviews.

### Keyword Research Tools (Budget-Friendly)

| Tool | Cost | Best For | Notes |
|------|------|----------|-------|
| **Google Search Console** | Free | Your own site's keywords | Install on day 1. Shows what you actually rank for. |
| **Google Keyword Planner** | Free (with Google Ads account) | Volume estimates | Requires a Google Ads account but you don't need to run ads |
| **Ubersuggest** | Free (3 searches/day) or $29/mo | Keyword ideas + difficulty | Good enough for your scale. Free tier is workable. |
| **AnswerThePublic** | Free (limited) | Question-based keywords | Great for blog topic ideation |
| **AlsoAsked.com** | Free (limited) | "People Also Ask" clusters | Maps related questions — goldmine for cluster articles |
| **Ahrefs Free Webmaster Tools** | Free | Backlink analysis + basic keywords | Limited but useful for checking competitor keywords |
| **Google Trends** | Free | Trending topics, seasonality | Check if "AI agent builder" is trending up or plateauing |

**Recommendation**: Start with Google Search Console + Google Keyword Planner + Ubersuggest free tier. That is $0/month and sufficient for 6+ months. Upgrade to Ubersuggest paid ($29/mo) or Ahrefs Lite ($99/mo) only when you have 50+ published pages and need to track rankings at scale.

### Realistic Timeline for Organic Traffic

| Timeframe | What to Expect | Monthly Organic Sessions |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Months 1-3 | Mostly zero organic traffic. Google is indexing your content. | 0-100 |
| Months 4-6 | Long-tail keywords start ranking (positions 10-30). A few articles get clicks. | 100-500 |
| Months 7-9 | Best articles break into top 10. Compound effect kicks in. | 500-2,000 |
| Months 10-12 | Topical authority builds. Multiple articles in top 5 for long-tail terms. | 2,000-5,000 |
| Year 2 | If consistent, 50+ articles create a flywheel. Some moderate-volume terms rank. | 5,000-15,000 |

**The critical insight**: Most solo founders quit content marketing at month 3-4 because they see no results. The ones who persist to month 8-10 see compounding returns. Set expectations accordingly.

## 4. Content Repurposing Workflow

This is your highest-leverage system. One 60-90 minute workshop should produce 5-8 pieces of content with an additional 3-5 hours of work.

### The Workshop-to-Content Pipeline

```
WORKSHOP (60-90 min)
    |
    ├── [1] Full Recording → YouTube (long-form)
    |       Time: 1-2 hrs (trim + upload)
    |
    ├── [2] Workshop Recap Blog Post
    |       Time: 2-3 hrs (write from notes + recording)
    |
    ├── [3] 3-5 Short Video Clips → LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube Shorts
    |       Time: 1-2 hrs (extract + format)
    |
    ├── [4] Key Takeaways → Twitter/X Thread
    |       Time: 30 min
    |
    ├── [5] Email Newsletter → Workshop highlights + "Build your own" CTA
    |       Time: 30-45 min
    |
    ├── [6] Documentation Update → Add FAQ or guide based on common questions
    |       Time: 1-2 hrs
    |
    └── [7] Social Media Posts → 3-5 posts across platforms
            Time: 30-45 min
```

**Total additional time**: 6-10 hours per workshop (spread across 1-2 weeks)
**Total content pieces**: 7+ items from one event

### Step-by-Step with Tools

#### Step 1: Record the Workshop
- **Tool**: OBS Studio (free) for screen + webcam, or a simple external camera/phone on a tripod for the room view
- **Audio**: Rode USB-C Mini or Blue Yeti ($60-$130 one-time) — audio quality is non-negotiable
- **Backup**: Record with phone as backup (in case primary recording fails)
- **Time**: 0 additional hours (you are already giving the workshop)

#### Step 2: Full Video Upload to YouTube
- **Tool**: Descript (free tier for first 10 hrs/mo) — import recording, auto-transcribe, cut dead air and filler words, export
- **Process**: Import to Descript, remove the first/last 5 minutes (setup/teardown), add a 5-second branded intro card (Canva template), export, upload to YouTube with optimized title/description/tags
- **Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Quality bar**: Does not need to be polished. Workshop recordings are valued for authenticity, not production quality.

#### Step 3: Blog Post from Workshop Content
- **Tool**: Use the Descript transcript as your first draft. Feed it into Claude/ChatGPT with the prompt: "Turn this workshop transcript into a 1,200-word blog post. Keep the conversational tone. Structure it with subheadings. Include actionable takeaways."
- **Process**: Edit the AI draft heavily — add your specific examples, remove generic advice, add screenshots from the workshop, add a CTA to try Teach Charlie
- **Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Quality bar**: Must include at least one original insight or story from the actual workshop that an AI could not have generated.

#### Step 4: Short Video Clips (3-5 clips, 30-90 seconds each)
- **Tool**: Descript (clip directly from the full video), Opus Clip (free tier — AI-selected highlights), or manual selection
- **Process**: Identify 3-5 moments that are: funny, insightful, surprising, or show a "before/after" moment. Export as vertical video (9:16) for LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube Shorts.
- **Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Quality bar**: Each clip must be independently interesting — someone who did not attend the workshop should understand and enjoy it.

#### Step 5: Twitter/X Thread
- **Tool**: Your keyboard. Optionally use Typefully (free tier) for scheduling.
- **Process**: Pull 5-7 key takeaways from the workshop. Write them as a numbered thread. First tweet should be a hook: "I just taught 20 small business owners to build their first AI agent. Here's what surprised me:" End with a CTA to the full blog post or video.
- **Time**: 30 minutes
- **Quality bar**: Each tweet should stand alone. No fluff.

#### Step 6: Email Newsletter
- **Tool**: ConvertKit/Beehiiv free tier, or whatever you already use
- **Process**: 300-500 word email with: 1 key insight from the workshop, 1 screenshot or quote from an attendee, 1 CTA (either "try Teach Charlie" or "attend the next workshop")
- **Time**: 30-45 minutes
- **Quality bar**: Must feel personal, not like marketing. Write it like you are texting a friend about what happened.

#### Step 7: Documentation Update
- **Process**: Review questions people asked during the workshop. If any question came up more than once, it reveals a gap in your documentation. Write or update a doc page that answers it.
- **Time**: 1-2 hours (only if a genuine gap exists)
- **Quality bar**: The doc page should be SEO-optimized (title with keyword, proper heading structure, internal links).

### Content Repurposing Calendar (Week After Workshop)

| Day | Task | Time | Output |
|-----|------|------|--------|
| Day 1 (same day) | Upload raw recording to Descript for transcription | 15 min | Transcript |
| Day 2 | Edit and upload full video to YouTube | 1.5 hrs | YouTube video |
| Day 2 | Post 1 social media announcement about the recording | 15 min | Social post |
| Day 3 | Write blog post from transcript | 2.5 hrs | Blog post |
| Day 3 | Extract 3 short clips from recording | 1 hr | 3 short videos |
| Day 4 | Write and send email newsletter | 45 min | Newsletter |
| Day 4 | Write Twitter/X thread | 30 min | Thread |
| Day 5 | Post 1 short clip to LinkedIn + TikTok/YouTube Shorts | 30 min | Social video |
| Day 6 | Post 1 more short clip | 15 min | Social video |
| Day 7 | Update documentation if needed | 1-2 hrs | Doc page |

**Total time over the week**: 7-9 hours
**Total content pieces**: 8-10 items

## 5. Comparison Content Strategy

### Which Competitors to Target (and Why)

| Competitor | Create Page? | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **ChatGPT Custom GPTs** | YES (top priority) | Your #1 competitor by user overlap. Most of your target audience tries GPTs first. You need to articulate why a dedicated builder is different. |
| **Botpress** | YES | Strong brand in chatbot space. They are technical — you can win on "easier for non-technical users." |
| **Voiceflow** | YES | Well-known, good docs. Position as "simpler alternative for people who don't need enterprise features." |
| **Chatbase** | YES | Direct competitor in "simple chatbot builder" space. Similar audience. |
| **Zapier AI/Chatbots** | YES | Many of your users already use Zapier. Important to differentiate "automation" vs "AI agent." |
| **Langflow** | YES (different angle) | Not "vs" — instead "Teach Charlie: Langflow Made Easy for Business Users." You are built on Langflow, so this is a "we make it accessible" story. |
| **Intercom/Drift/Zendesk AI** | NO | Different category (customer support platforms with AI features). Your audience is not cross-shopping these. |
| **IBM Watson** | NO | Enterprise-only. Your audience cannot afford it and is not looking at it. |
| **Microsoft Copilot Studio** | MAYBE later | Growing, but currently enterprise-focused. Revisit in 6 months. |
| **Bland AI / Vapi** | NO | Voice AI — different product category. |

### Comparison Page Template

Every comparison page should follow this exact structure. This structure is optimized for both SEO (Google rewards comprehensive, structured comparisons) and conversion (the reader should conclude that Teach Charlie is the right choice for their specific situation).

```
URL: /compare/teach-charlie-vs-[competitor]

TITLE: "Teach Charlie vs [Competitor]: Which AI Agent Builder Is Right for You?"

SECTION 1: The Quick Answer (50 words)
- For people who just want the bottom line
- "If you [specific situation], choose Teach Charlie. If you [different situation], 
  [Competitor] might be better."

SECTION 2: Who Is This Comparison For? (100 words)
- "This comparison is written for non-technical business owners and marketers..."
- Sets the frame: we are comparing from YOUR perspective, not a developer's

SECTION 3: Overview Table
| Feature | Teach Charlie | [Competitor] |
|---------|--------------:|-------------:|
| Best for | Non-technical users | [Their audience] |
| Learning curve | 15 minutes | [Their estimate] |
| Starting price | Free tier | [Their price] |
| No-code? | Yes | [Yes/Partially/No] |
| Custom knowledge | Yes (text, files, URLs) | [Their approach] |
| Embed on website | Yes | [Yes/No] |
| Workshop/training | Yes (live workshops) | [Docs only / etc.] |

SECTION 4: Detailed Comparison (800-1,200 words)
- 4-5 subsections comparing specific dimensions
- Use screenshots from both products
- Be HONEST about where the competitor is better

SECTION 5: When to Choose [Competitor] Instead (Critical for credibility)
- "Choose [Competitor] if you need [specific thing we don't do well]"
- This section builds trust and improves SEO (Google rewards balanced comparisons)

SECTION 6: When to Choose Teach Charlie
- "Choose Teach Charlie if you want to learn AI, not just use a tool"
- Tie back to your differentiation: education-first, non-technical, workshop support

SECTION 7: Try It Yourself (CTA)
- "The best way to decide? Try both. Teach Charlie has a free tier — 
  build your first agent in 15 minutes."
- Link to sign up
```

### SEO Considerations for Comparison Pages

1. **Competitor brand names as keywords are fair game** — Google explicitly allows comparison content. Use the competitor's name in the title, URL, H1, and meta description.

2. **Do NOT run Google Ads on competitor brand names** unless you have budget for the legal nuisance. Bidding on "Botpress" as a keyword is legal but can trigger aggressive responses from well-funded competitors. Organic comparison pages are safer and more sustainable.

3. **Schema markup**: Use FAQ schema on comparison pages (with 3-5 questions like "Is Teach Charlie easier than Botpress?" or "Can Teach Charlie do everything ChatGPT GPTs can?"). This increases the chance of appearing in featured snippets.

4. **Update quarterly**: Comparison pages go stale fast in AI. Set a calendar reminder to update each page every 3 months with the latest features from both products.

### Tone Guidelines

- **Never be negative about the competitor.** "Botpress is a powerful tool designed for developers" — not "Botpress is too complicated."
- **Acknowledge their strengths genuinely.** "Voiceflow has excellent documentation and a strong community." This builds trust with readers and protects you from looking petty.
- **Focus on fit, not superiority.** "Teach Charlie is designed for people who want to learn AI as they build, not just deploy a chatbot" — this is a positioning statement, not a put-down.
- **Use the phrase "right for you" frequently.** This signals to Google and readers that you are providing helpful, unbiased comparison content.

## 6. Educational Content Funnel

### Mapping Content to Buyer Journey Stages

```
AWARENESS                    CONSIDERATION                 DECISION                    RETENTION
"I need to learn about AI"   "I need to pick a tool"      "I'm ready to try/buy"     "I want to get better"
         |                          |                            |                          |

    "What is X?" articles     Integration guides            Workshop sign-up          Monthly newsletter
```

### Awareness Stage Content (Top of Funnel)

**Goal**: Attract people who do not yet know Teach Charlie exists. They are searching for information, not tools.

| Content Type | Example | CTA | Conversion Goal |
|-------------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| Blog: "What Is an AI Agent?" | Pillar 1, Article 1 | "Want to build one? Try Teach Charlie free" | Email signup or free trial |
| YouTube: "AI Explained for Business Owners" | Video #18 from strategy | Link in description to blog | YouTube subscriber |
| Social: "3 AI myths that waste small business owners' time" | LinkedIn post | Link to blog post | Website visit |
| Workshop promo: "Free AI Workshop This Saturday" | Local Facebook group post, Meetup event | Workshop registration | Attendee |
| Blog: "Why Learning AI Doesn't Mean Learning to Code" | Pillar 4, Article 5 | "See how easy it is — try Teach Charlie" | Free trial |

**Key metric**: Website sessions, email list growth, YouTube views
**Expected conversion rate to next stage**: 2-5% of visitors

### Consideration Stage Content (Middle of Funnel)

**Goal**: Help people who know they want an AI tool decide if Teach Charlie is the right one.

| Content Type | Example | CTA | Conversion Goal |
|-------------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| Comparison: "Teach Charlie vs ChatGPT GPTs" | Pillar 3, Article 1 | "Try both — Teach Charlie is free to start" | Free trial signup |
| Blog: "7 Best No-Code AI Agent Builders" | Pillar 3, Article 4 | "Start building with Teach Charlie" | Free trial signup |
| YouTube: "I Tested 5 AI Agent Builders" | Video #15 | Link to free trial | Free trial signup |
| Webinar: "How to Choose the Right AI Agent Builder" | Live or recorded | Register for next workshop | Workshop registration |
| Guide: "How to Train AI on Your Business Data" | Pillar 2, Article 12 | In-article product screenshots + CTA | Free trial signup |

**Key metric**: Free trial signups, workshop registrations, time-on-page
**Expected conversion rate to next stage**: 5-15% of consideration-stage visitors

### Decision Stage Content (Bottom of Funnel)

**Goal**: Remove the last objections and get the person to sign up, attend a workshop, or upgrade.

| Content Type | Example | CTA | Conversion Goal |
|-------------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| Case study: "How [Business] Built an AI Agent in 1 Workshop" | Written story + video testimonial | "Build yours — start free" | Paid conversion |
| Demo video: "See Teach Charlie in Action (3-Minute Tour)" | Screen recording walkthrough | Direct sign-up link | Free trial signup |
| Pricing page | Clear comparison of Free/Pro/Team | "Start Free" button | Paid conversion |
| Free trial email sequence | 5-email onboarding drip | "Build your first agent" | Activation (first agent built) |
| Workshop attendee follow-up | "Here's what you built — keep going!" | Login link + upgrade CTA | Paid conversion |

**Key metric**: Signups, paid conversions, workshop attendance
**Expected conversion rate**: 10-25% of decision-stage visitors

### Retention Stage Content (Post-Purchase)

**Goal**: Keep users engaged, reduce churn, create advocates who refer others.

| Content Type | Example | CTA | Conversion Goal |
|-------------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| Advanced tutorial: "5 Advanced Tricks for Your AI Agent" | Blog + video | "Try this in your agent" | Feature adoption |
| Monthly newsletter: "What's New + Tips" | Email newsletter | "Log in and try it" | Re-engagement |
| Missions/gamification | In-app guided challenges | Complete a mission | Feature discovery |
| Community: "Share Your Agent" Showcase | Social media feature or forum | "Share yours for a chance to be featured" | Advocacy/UGC |
| Tips email series: "AI Agent Tips of the Week" | 12-week drip campaign | One tip + one product feature per email | Retention |

**Key metric**: Monthly active users, feature adoption, NPS, referrals

### Content Funnel Allocation (Where to Spend Your Limited Time)

| Funnel Stage | % of Content Time | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Awareness | 30% | Fills the top of funnel. Without awareness, nothing else works. |
| Consideration | 35% | This is where your differentiation shines. Comparison content converts well. |
| Decision | 15% | Fewer pieces needed, but each one is high-impact. Case studies + demos. |
| Retention | 20% | Neglected by most startups. Retention content reduces churn, which is more efficient than acquisition. |

---

## 7. Documentation as Marketing

You already have 20 public doc pages (10 user guides + 10 developer docs). This is a meaningful SEO asset that most competitors neglect.

### Why Documentation Matters for SEO

1. **Google loves comprehensive, well-structured documentation.** It signals topical expertise (E-E-A-T).
2. **Documentation pages capture long-tail search traffic** from people searching for specific solutions.
3. **Documentation reduces support burden** — fewer "how do I...?" emails means more time for content creation.
4. **Documentation builds trust** — a well-documented product signals a serious, reliable company.

### Optimization Checklist for Existing 20 Pages

Apply these optimizations to every existing doc page:

#### On-Page SEO
- [ ] **Title tag**: Include primary keyword + brand. Example: "How to Build Your First AI Agent | Teach Charlie Docs"
- [ ] **Meta description**: 150-160 characters, include keyword, include a benefit statement
- [ ] **H1**: One per page, matches the title tag (or close to it)
- [ ] **H2/H3 hierarchy**: Proper nesting, include secondary keywords in subheadings
- [ ] **Internal links**: Every doc page should link to 2-3 other doc pages and 1-2 blog posts
- [ ] **External links**: Link to 1-2 authoritative sources (Google AI docs, Wikipedia for technical terms)
- [ ] **Images**: Add alt text with descriptive keywords. Screenshots should have captions.
- [ ] **URL structure**: Clean, keyword-rich URLs. `/docs/build-first-ai-agent` not `/docs/page-7`

#### Content Enhancements
- [ ] **FAQ section at the bottom**: Add 3-5 FAQs to each doc page. Use FAQ schema markup. These FAQs can rank in Google's "People Also Ask" boxes.
- [ ] **"Next Steps" section**: At the bottom of every page, suggest the logical next action. "Now that you have built your first agent, learn how to train it on your business data."
- [ ] **Difficulty indicator**: Add a "Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced" badge to each doc page. This helps users self-select and signals to Google that you serve multiple skill levels.
- [ ] **Estimated time**: "This guide takes approximately 10 minutes." Reduces bounce rate because users know what they are committing to.
- [ ] **Video embed**: Where possible, embed a corresponding YouTube tutorial. This increases time-on-page (good for SEO) and gives users a choice of learning format.

### New Documentation Pages to Create (Prioritized)

| Page | Target Keyword | SEO Value | Priority |
|------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| "Glossary: AI Terms Explained for Business Users" | "AI glossary for beginners" | High (FAQ-rich, long-tail magnet) | Very High |
| "Troubleshooting: Common Issues and Fixes" | "AI chatbot not working" + specific errors | Medium (captures frustrated users of any tool) | High |
| "Getting Started: Build Your First Agent in 15 Minutes" | "build AI agent tutorial" | High (captures high-intent traffic) | Very High |
| "API Reference for Embed Widget" | "embed AI chatbot API" | Medium (developer-adjacent traffic) | Medium |
| "Integration Guides" (one page per major integration) | "[integration] AI agent" | Medium each, high aggregate | High |
| "Templates Gallery" | "AI agent templates" | High (people search for templates) | Very High |
| "Pricing & Plans Explained" | "Teach Charlie pricing" | Medium (bottom-funnel) | High |
| "Security & Privacy FAQ" | "AI chatbot security" | Medium (trust-building) | Medium |
| "Workshop Materials: Build Along at Home" | "AI workshop materials free" | Medium (captures workshop-adjacent searches) | Medium |
| "Changelog: What's New in Teach Charlie" | Brand searches | Low direct SEO, high trust signal | Low |

### Internal Linking Strategy

**Hub-and-Spoke Model**: Your documentation should have a central "Getting Started" page that links to every other doc page. Every doc page should link back to "Getting Started" and to 2-3 related doc pages.

**Blog-to-Docs Links**: Every blog post that mentions a feature should link to the corresponding doc page. This passes "link juice" from your content-marketing pages to your documentation.

**Docs-to-Blog Links**: Each doc page should link to 1-2 relevant blog posts in a "Learn More" section. This keeps documentation visitors in your ecosystem and exposes them to conversion-oriented content.

**Anchor Text**: Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text. "Learn how to train your AI agent on your business documents" — not "click here."

## 8. Social Media Strategy

### Platform Selection (Where Your Users Actually Are)

| Platform | Target User Presence | Content Type | Priority | Time Investment |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **LinkedIn** | HIGH — SMB owners, marketing managers, professional learners | Text posts, articles, short video, carousels | #1 Priority | 3-4 hrs/week |
| **YouTube** | MEDIUM — tutorial seekers, workshop audience | Long-form tutorials, workshop recordings, comparisons | #2 Priority | 2-4 hrs/week (Phase 2+) |
| **Twitter/X** | MEDIUM — AI enthusiasts, tech-adjacent professionals | Threads, quick tips, engagement with AI conversations | #3 Priority | 1-2 hrs/week |
| **TikTok** | LOW-MEDIUM — younger workshop attendees, viral potential | Short demos, "I built this in 60 seconds" clips | #4 Priority | 1 hr/week (repurposed clips) |
| **Instagram** | LOW — some SMB owners, workshop photos | Stories, reels (repurposed from TikTok), behind-the-scenes | #5 Priority | 30 min/week (repurposed) |
| **Facebook** | MEDIUM for local — local business groups, event promotion | Workshop announcements, group participation | Situational | 1 hr/week (event-driven) |

### LinkedIn Strategy (Your Primary Platform)

**Why LinkedIn is #1**: Your target users (SMB owners 35-50, marketing managers 28-40) are on LinkedIn daily. LinkedIn's algorithm heavily favors text posts from personal accounts (not company pages). The AI conversation is extremely active on LinkedIn. You can build a meaningful following with 3-5 posts per week.

**Posting Frequency**: 4-5 times per week (Monday through Friday)
**Time Investment**: 30-45 minutes per post (including engagement with comments)
**Total weekly time**: 3-4 hours

**Content Mix** (weekly):
- 2x Educational/insight posts (AI tips, lessons from workshops, debunking myths)
- 1x Personal story or behind-the-scenes (building Teach Charlie, workshop moments)
- 1x Promotional (workshop announcement, feature update, blog post link)
- 1x Engagement post (question, poll, "what would you build?")

**LinkedIn Post Templates**:

**Template 1: The Workshop Insight**
```
Last week I taught 15 small business owners to build AI agents.

The #1 thing that surprised them?

[Specific insight from the workshop]

Here's what they learned:

1. [Lesson 1]
2. [Lesson 2]  
3. [Lesson 3]

The agent that impressed me most: [brief description].

If you want to try building your own, link in comments.

#AIforBusiness #SmallBusiness #NoCode
```

**Template 2: The Myth Buster**
```
"You need to know how to code to use AI in your business."

I hear this at every workshop. It's wrong.

Here's what you ACTUALLY need:

→ A clear idea of what questions your customers ask
→ 15 minutes
→ That's it

[Brief description of how Teach Charlie makes this possible]

What's the biggest myth about AI you've heard?
```

**Template 3: The Before/After**
```
Before the workshop: "AI is for big tech companies"
After the workshop: "Wait, I just built a working AI agent for my [business type]?"

This happens every single time.

[Photo or screenshot from workshop]

Next workshop: [Date/Location]. Link in comments.
```

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Why Twitter/X matters**: The AI conversation is extremely active on Twitter/X. AI influencers, founders, and early adopters are here. It is a good place to build credibility and connect with potential partners/advocates.

**Posting Frequency**: 1-2 posts per day (use a scheduling tool)
**Time Investment**: 1-2 hours per week (mostly repurposed content)

**What works on Twitter/X for AI content**:
- Threads (5-10 tweets) that teach something specific
- Quick tips or surprising facts about AI
- Screenshots of AI agents doing interesting things
- Engaging with larger AI accounts (reply thoughtfully to AI influencers — this gets you visibility)
- "Build in public" updates (what you are working on, what you learned)

**What does NOT work**:
- Direct product promotion (will be ignored)
- Long-form content (save that for LinkedIn or blog)
- Being negative about competitors (toxic on Twitter/X)

### TikTok Strategy (Low-Effort, High-Optional-Upside)

**Why consider TikTok**: "Build an AI agent in 60 seconds" videos have viral potential. The effort is minimal if you are already creating workshop clips and screen recordings.

**Posting Frequency**: 2-3 times per week (all repurposed content)
**Time Investment**: 1 hour per week maximum (just reformatting existing clips)

**What works**:
- 30-60 second screen recordings showing the "build" process sped up
- "I built an AI [job] in 60 seconds" format
- Workshop moments where someone reacts to their AI working
- Quick tips with text overlay

**Do NOT create original content for TikTok.** Only post content that was already created for another platform, reformatted to vertical video.

### Social Media Tools (Budget-Friendly)

| Tool | Purpose | Cost | Notes |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| **Buffer** | Scheduling posts across platforms | Free (3 channels) or $6/mo | Simple, reliable, sufficient |
| **Canva** | Graphics, carousels, thumbnails | Free tier | Essential for LinkedIn carousels |
| **Later** | Instagram/TikTok scheduling | Free tier | Only needed if actively posting to these |
| **Typefully** | Twitter/X thread writing + scheduling | Free tier | Clean interface for drafting threads |
| **LinkedIn native** | LinkedIn posting | Free | LinkedIn penalizes posts with external links in the body — put links in comments |

**Recommended stack**: Buffer free tier + Canva free tier = $0/month

### Monthly Social Media Calendar (Example)

| Week | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | LinkedIn: Workshop insight | Twitter: AI tip | LinkedIn: Blog post promo | Twitter: Thread on topic | LinkedIn: Question/poll |
| 2 | LinkedIn: Behind-the-scenes | Twitter: AI tip | LinkedIn: Carousel (5 tips) | Twitter: Build-in-public update | LinkedIn: Personal story |
| 3 | LinkedIn: Myth buster | Twitter: AI tip | LinkedIn: Feature announcement | Twitter: Thread on topic | LinkedIn: Before/after |
| 4 | LinkedIn: Workshop promo | Twitter: AI tip | LinkedIn: Case study/testimonial | Twitter: Engagement post | LinkedIn: Week recap |

**TikTok/YouTube Shorts**: Post 2-3 repurposed clips throughout the month, whenever you have them ready. No strict schedule needed.

## Appendix A: Content Creation Workflow for a Solo Founder

### The "2-Hour Content Block" System

Since you have approximately 20 hours per week for non-technical work, and content is one of several priorities (alongside sales, workshops, operations), you can realistically dedicate 4-6 hours per week to content creation.

**Recommended weekly schedule**:

| Day | Time Block | Activity | Output |
|-----|-----------|----------|--------|
| Monday | 30 min | Write LinkedIn post + schedule week's social media | 5 social posts scheduled |
| Tuesday | 2 hrs | Write/edit 1 blog article | Blog post (or half of one if longer) |
| Wednesday | 30 min | LinkedIn engagement (comment on others' posts) | Visibility + relationships |
| Thursday | 1.5 hrs | Video recording OR blog editing | 1 video or 1 polished article |
| Friday | 30 min | Newsletter draft or doc update | 1 newsletter or 1 doc improvement |

**Total**: ~5 hours/week on content
**Monthly output**: 2-3 blog articles, 1-2 videos, 20 social posts, 2 newsletters

### Quality vs. Quantity Decision Framework

For every piece of content, ask:

1. **Does this teach something my audience cannot easily learn elsewhere?** If no, skip it.
2. **Would I be proud to share this with a workshop attendee?** If no, improve it.
3. **Does this naturally lead to trying Teach Charlie?** If no, add a bridge.
4. **Can I create this in under 3 hours?** If no, simplify or break it into parts.

**The rule**: One excellent article per month outperforms four mediocre articles per month. Your audience is non-technical people who are already overwhelmed by AI content. They need clarity and trust, not volume.

### Monthly Dashboard (Keep It Simple)

| Metric | Tool | Target (Month 6) | Target (Month 12) |
|--------|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Organic website sessions | Google Analytics / Search Console | 500 | 3,000 |
| Blog articles published (cumulative) | Manual count | 15 | 30 |
| Email list size | Email tool dashboard | 500 | 2,000 |
| LinkedIn followers | LinkedIn | 1,000 | 3,000 |
| YouTube subscribers | YouTube Studio | 200 | 1,000 |
| Free trial signups from content | UTM tracking | 50/mo | 200/mo |
| Top 10 Google rankings | Google Search Console | 10 keywords | 40 keywords |
| Workshop registrations from content | UTM tracking | 10/mo | 30/mo |

**Do NOT track more than these 8-10 metrics.** More metrics means more time dashboarding and less time creating. Review monthly, not daily.

## Appendix C: The First 30 Days Action Plan

If you can only do one thing from each section, do these:

| Week | Action | Time | Output |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| Week 1 | Install Google Search Console on your docs site. Write and publish "Teach Charlie vs ChatGPT GPTs" comparison article. | 4 hrs | 1 article + analytics setup |
| Week 2 | Write and publish "How to Build an AI Agent Without Coding" blog post. Start posting on LinkedIn (3 posts this week). | 5 hrs | 1 article + 3 social posts |
| Week 3 | Record your next workshop. Optimize 5 existing doc pages (title tags, meta descriptions, internal links, FAQ sections). | 4 hrs | 1 recording + 5 optimized pages |
| Week 4 | Upload workshop recording to YouTube. Write recap blog post. Send first newsletter to your email list. | 5 hrs | 1 video + 1 article + 1 newsletter |

**Total time over 30 days**: ~18 hours (spread across the month)
**Total output**: 3 blog articles, 1 YouTube video, 5 optimized doc pages, 12+ social posts, 1 newsletter, analytics tracking installed

This 30-day sprint creates the foundation. Everything after this is maintenance and iteration on a system that compounds.

## Final Note: The 80/20 of This Entire Strategy

If you read nothing else, remember these five things:

1. **Record every workshop.** It is the single highest-ROI content activity you can do. Everything else flows from it.

2. **Write comparison content first.** "Teach Charlie vs ChatGPT GPTs" and "Best No-Code AI Agent Builders" will drive more signups than any educational article, because the reader is already looking for a tool.

3. **LinkedIn is your platform.** Your audience is there. The algorithm rewards personal-account text posts. You do not need to be on every platform — be excellent on one.

4. **Long-tail keywords are your path to organic traffic.** You cannot compete with OpenAI for "AI chatbot." You can absolutely own "how to build an AI agent without coding for small business."

5. **Consistency beats brilliance.** Two solid articles per month for 12 months will outperform a burst of 10 articles in month 1 followed by silence. Set a sustainable pace and maintain it.
