# Welcome to Teach Charlie AI

Teach Charlie AI is an educational platform that makes building AI agents simple and fun. Whether you're a small business owner, marketer, or just curious about AI, you're in the right place.

## What is Teach Charlie AI?

Think of Teach Charlie AI as a **dog training school for AI**. Just like you'd train a puppy to sit, fetch, and follow commands, you'll teach Charlie (your AI agent) how to:

- Answer customer questions
- Help with sales inquiries
- Provide support and assistance
- Connect to your favorite tools
- And much more!

## The "Dog Trainer" Metaphor

We use the "Dog Trainer" metaphor because it makes AI concepts easy to understand:

| AI Concept | Dog Training Equivalent |
|------------|------------------------|
| System Prompt | Charlie's Job Description |
| Temperature | Creativity Level |
| Knowledge Sources | Training Materials |
| Tools/Actions | Tricks to Perform |
| Conversation Memory | Remembering Past Interactions |

> **Tip:** Throughout this documentation, we'll use friendly terms instead of technical jargon. When you see "Charlie," we're talking about your AI agent!

## What Can You Build?

With Teach Charlie AI, you can create agents for:

- **Customer Support**: Answer FAQs, handle inquiries, route to humans when needed

## Platform Features

Create agents without any coding. Just answer three simple questions:

2. What are the rules? (How should they behave?)
3. What tricks do they know? (What tools can they use?)

### Chat Playground
