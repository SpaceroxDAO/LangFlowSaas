# Quick Start Guide

Create your first AI agent in just 5 minutes! By the end of this guide, you'll have Charlie trained and ready to chat.

## Prerequisites

- A Teach Charlie AI account (sign up at the [homepage](/) if you don't have one)
- That's it! No coding required.

## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Sign in to your dashboard
2. Click **"New Project"** in the sidebar
3. Give your project a name (e.g., "My First Agent")

Projects help you organize your agents and workflows. Think of them like folders for your trained Charlies!

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

1. Inside your project, click **"Create Agent"**
2. You'll see the 3-Step Q&A Wizard

### Question 1: Who is Charlie?

Choose a preset or describe Charlie's role:

- **Customer Support Agent** - Answers questions and helps users
- **Sales Assistant** - Qualifies leads and schedules demos
- **Knowledge Expert** - Answers questions from your documentation
- **Custom** - Describe any role you want

> **Tip:** You can also select from 8 preset templates that come pre-configured for common use cases!

### Question 2: What Are the Rules?

This is Charlie's "job description." Tell Charlie:

- How to greet users
- What tone to use (friendly, professional, casual)
- What topics to focus on
- What to avoid

**Example:**
```
You are a friendly customer support agent for Acme Corp.
Always be helpful and professional. If you don't know
something, politely say so and offer to connect the
user with a human agent.
```

### Question 3: What Tricks Does Charlie Know?

Select the tools and actions Charlie can perform:

- **Search Knowledge** - Look up information in your documents
- **Send Email** - Compose and send emails
- **Schedule Meeting** - Book appointments via calendar
- **Browse Web** - Look up current information online

Don't worry if you're not sure yet—you can always add more tools later!

## Step 3: Test in the Playground

After creating your agent, you'll be taken to the **Playground**. This is where you chat with Charlie to see how they respond.

1. Type a message in the chat box
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. Watch Charlie respond in real-time!

### Tips for Testing

- Try different types of questions
- Test edge cases (what happens if someone asks about something unrelated?)
- Adjust Charlie's rules if needed

## Step 4: Make Adjustments

Not happy with Charlie's responses? No problem!

1. Click **"Edit Agent"** at the top
2. Adjust the rules or tools
3. Save changes
4. Test again in the Playground

This iterative process is how you "train" Charlie to be exactly what you need.

## Common Questions

### Can I have multiple agents?

Yes! You can create as many agents as your plan allows. Each can have different personalities, knowledge, and tools.

### How do I share my agent with others?

Once you're happy with Charlie, you can:
1. **Embed** - Add to your website with a code snippet
2. **Publish** - Turn into a reusable component
3. **Export** - Download and share the configuration

### What if something goes wrong?

Charlie will always try to be helpful. If they can't answer a question, they'll say so. You can also configure fallback messages and human handoff in the settings.
