# TEACH CHARLIE AI — WORKSHOP STRATEGY PLAYBOOK

## Complete Launch Playbook Section: Workshops as Primary Growth Engine

## STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

**Why Workshops Are Your #1 Growth Channel**

You have a rare founder-market fit advantage: 10+ years of in-person selling and no-code education experience combined with a product that *must be experienced* to be understood. Workshop-led growth is your unfair advantage over every VC-backed AI startup relying on paid ads and content marketing.

The math: A single 20-person workshop converting at 30% to free signups, with 20% of those converting to $49/mo Pro plans within 30 days, generates $59/mo in recurring revenue per workshop. At 4 workshops/month, that is $235/mo new MRR added monthly. By month 12, you are at $2,820 MRR from workshops alone — and that is the conservative floor assuming zero organic growth, zero referrals, and zero upsells.

But workshops do more than generate revenue. They produce:
- **Product feedback** from watching real users struggle in real time
- **Testimonials and case studies** from attendees who build something live
- **Content** (recordings, slides, photos) for marketing
- **Community** that retains and refers
- **Authority positioning** that opens doors to corporate deals

**The Constraint Budget**: $100-$500/month, ~20 hrs/week non-technical time. Every recommendation below is designed within these limits.

## 1. WORKSHOP CURRICULUM DESIGN

### Format A: 60-Minute "AI Tasting" — Intro Workshop

**Purpose**: Low-barrier introduction for non-technical audiences. Free or venue-sponsored. Primary goal: collect emails, create "aha moment," drive signups.

**Ideal Venues**: Public libraries, community centers, senior centers, Rotary Club meetings, church groups, neighborhood business associations.

**Audience Size**: 10-30 people. Works best at 15-20.

**Materials Needed**:
- Laptop with HDMI/USB-C to HDMI adapter ($15 one-time)
- Portable Bluetooth clicker/presenter ($20 one-time)
- Printed one-page handouts, 30 copies ($8 per workshop at Staples/FedEx)
- QR code stand or large printed QR code ($5 one-time)
- Name tags and markers ($3 per workshop)
- Wi-Fi access (confirm with venue 48 hours before)

**Total recurring cost per workshop**: ~$11

**Slide Count**: 18 slides (Google Slides — free)

**Handout Content (single sheet, double-sided)**:
- Front: "Your AI Agent Starter Card" — QR code to app.teachcharlie.ai, the 3 questions they will answer, 4 example agents (Customer Service Charlie, Marketing Charlie, HR Charlie, Sales Charlie), coupon code for 14-day Pro trial
- Back: "AI Vocabulary Cheat Sheet" — 12 terms defined in plain English (AI Agent, Prompt, RAG, Integration, etc.), plus "What to Try This Week" with 3 homework challenges

#### MINUTE-BY-MINUTE BREAKDOWN

**Minutes 0:00–2:00 — THE OPENING HOOK** (Verbatim Script)

Stand at the front. No slides yet. Screen is off or showing the Teach Charlie logo.

> "Hey everyone, thanks for being here. Quick question before we start — raise your hand if you've heard the phrase 'artificial intelligence' at least five times this week."
>
> [Wait. Most hands go up. Smile.]
>
> "Okay, now keep your hand up if you could explain to your neighbor what AI actually *does* for a small business."
>
> [Pause. Watch hands drop. Laugh warmly.]
>
> "That's exactly why we're here. I'm [Name], and I've spent the last ten years helping people like you — business owners, marketing folks, people who are *great* at what they do but didn't sign up to become software engineers — I help people like you use technology without the headache.
>
> Here's what I want you to know: by the end of the next 55 minutes, you're going to watch me build a working AI assistant — live, from scratch — in under three minutes. No coding. No technical background needed. And if you want, you'll get to try it yourself before you leave.
>
> I'm not going to sell you anything tonight. What I *am* going to do is show you something that took me ten years in this industry to understand: AI isn't magic. It's a tool. And the people who learn to use it first are going to have an enormous advantage.
>
> Let's get started."

[Click to Slide 1: "What If You Could Clone Your Best Employee?"]

**Why this opening matters**: It does four things in 120 seconds: (1) creates participatory energy with hand-raising, (2) validates the audience's confusion as normal, (3) establishes your credibility without bragging, (4) sets a concrete promise (build an AI agent in 3 minutes) that creates anticipation. The "I'm not going to sell you anything" line is critical — it drops the audience's guard and paradoxically makes them *more* receptive to your CTA later.

---

**Minutes 2:00–10:00 — "AI Is Just a Really Fast Intern" (Context Setting)**

Slides 2-5.

- **Slide 2**: "What AI Can Do Today" — Three columns: What it's great at (answering questions, summarizing, writing drafts), What it's okay at (creative work, analysis), What it can't do (make decisions for you, replace relationships, be 100% accurate). *Spend 90 seconds.*
- **Slide 3**: "The AI Agent Concept" — Simple visual: a person talks to a box, the box has a job description, the box answers. Use the dog metaphor: "Think of an AI agent like training a really smart dog. You tell it its job, you set the rules, and you teach it tricks. That's literally what we're going to do." *Spend 90 seconds.*
- **Slide 4**: "Real Examples" — Show 4 real use cases with before/after: (1) A bakery using an AI agent to answer "Are your cupcakes gluten-free?" on their website 24/7, (2) A real estate agent with a listing Q&A bot, (3) A nonprofit using one for volunteer FAQ, (4) A fitness coach with a nutrition Q&A agent. Keep these relatable to the audience. *Spend 2 minutes.*
- **Slide 5**: "The 3 Questions" — Preview the framework: "Who is Charlie? What are Charlie's rules? What tricks does Charlie know?" Simple. Memorable. *Spend 1 minute.*

Interaction: After Slide 4, ask: "Quick — who here has a question they get asked over and over in their work? Shout one out." Take 2-3 answers. Write them on a whiteboard or say them back. "Perfect. That's exactly the kind of thing an AI agent handles for you."

---

**Minutes 10:00–25:00 — LIVE DEMO: "Build Charlie in 3 Minutes"**

Slides 6-8 (but mostly live screen).

- **Slide 6**: "Let's Build One — Live" — Transition slide. Switch to live browser.
- **LIVE SCREEN**: Navigate to app.teachcharlie.ai. Show the signup process (use a pre-made demo account to avoid delays). Click "Create New Agent."
- Walk through the 3-step Q&A wizard out loud:
  - **Step 1 — "Who is Charlie?"**: "I'm going to make Charlie a customer service agent for a coffee shop. Watch how simple this is." Select the Customer Service preset or type a description.
  - **Step 2 — "What are Charlie's rules?"**: "I'll tell Charlie to always be friendly, always recommend our seasonal special, and never make up information he doesn't know."
  - **Step 3 — "What tricks does Charlie know?"**: Show one integration or tool. Keep it simple — maybe a knowledge base with the coffee shop's menu.
- Click "Create" and show the agent being built.
- Switch to the Playground. Send a test message: "Do you have oat milk?"
- Show Charlie responding accurately based on the rules.
- Send a harder question: "What's the Wi-Fi password?" Show Charlie saying "I don't have that information — let me connect you with the team."
- **Total demo time**: 8-10 minutes. Rehearse this until you can do it in 7.

**Slide 7**: Brief pause slide — "What just happened?" Recap: You answered 3 questions. An AI agent was created. It's already working. No code. No engineering degree.

**Slide 8**: "What would YOUR agent do?" — Transition to participation.

**Troubleshooting**: If Wi-Fi fails, have a screen recording of this exact demo saved locally as a backup MP4. Practice the demo 5 times before your first workshop. Have a second browser tab with the playground already open in case the creation flow has a hiccup.

---

**Minutes 25:00–40:00 — AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION: "Design Your Agent"**

Slides 9-12.

- **Slide 9**: "Your Turn — Grab a Handout" — Direct people to the handout. Point to the 3 questions.
- **Activity (10 minutes)**: Have each person write down answers to the 3 questions for THEIR business on the back of the handout (or on a blank card you provide). Walk around the room. Help people who are stuck. Give examples. Be encouraging.
- **Slide 10**: "Let's Hear Some!" — Ask 3-4 volunteers to share what they wrote. React enthusiastically. "Oh, a travel agent Charlie — that's brilliant. Imagine your clients getting instant trip recommendations at 2am."
- **Slide 11**: Show the QR code to app.teachcharlie.ai. "If you want to try building yours right now on your phone, scan this QR code. You don't need to — but if you're curious, go for it."
- **Slide 12**: For those who sign up live, walk them through the first screen. "Everyone who just scanned — you should see a 'Create Agent' button. Go ahead and tap it."

**Why the participation moment matters**: This is where the workshop shifts from passive to active. People who *write down* their agent idea are 3x more likely to sign up later. People who sign up *in the room* are 5x more likely to become active users. The social proof of others scanning the QR code creates momentum.

---

**Minutes 40:00–50:00 — "The Bigger Picture" + Q&A**

Slides 13-16.

- **Slide 13**: "What Else Can AI Agents Do?" — Show the breadth: embed on your website, connect to 500+ tools, add knowledge bases, create agent teams. Keep this aspirational, not detailed.
- **Slide 14**: "The AI Adoption Curve" — Simple chart showing Early Adopters → Early Majority. "You're here tonight. That puts you ahead of 90% of small businesses. The question isn't whether AI will change your industry — it's whether you'll be the one using it or the one disrupted by it."
- **Slide 15**: "Questions?" — Open Q&A for 8-10 minutes. Common questions to prepare for:
  - "Is this going to replace my employees?" (No — it handles repetitive tasks so your team can focus on relationships.)
  - "How much does it cost?" (Free to start, Pro plans start at $49/mo.)
  - "Is my data safe?" (Yes, explain briefly.)
  - "Do I need technical skills?" (You just watched me build one in 3 minutes.)
  - "What if the AI gives wrong answers?" (That's what the 'rules' step is for — you control it.)
- **Slide 16**: Transition to close.

---

**Minutes 50:00–58:00 — THE CLOSE + CTA**

Slides 17-18.

- **Slide 17**: "Your Next Step" — Three clear options:
  1. **Try it free tonight**: Scan QR code → app.teachcharlie.ai (free account, no credit card)
  2. **Join our next hands-on workshop**: "Next [date], I'm running a 90-minute session where you'll actually build your agent and walk out with it working. Space is limited to 15 people. Sign up at [URL]." Show QR code for registration.
  3. **Get the replay + cheat sheet**: "Drop your email in the signup sheet going around and I'll send you tonight's slides plus a step-by-step guide."

- **Slide 18**: "Thank You" slide with: your name, email, website, QR code, and the line: "The best time to start using AI was yesterday. The second best time is tonight."

**Minutes 58:00–60:00 — MINGLE**

Stay in the room. Be available. This is where the best conversations happen. People who are too shy to ask questions publicly will approach you now. Have business cards (Vistaprint, $20 for 250). Collect the email signup sheet.

---

**Post-Workshop Admin (30 minutes)**:
- Photograph the signup sheet, enter emails into your email tool (ConvertKit, Mailchimp)
- Send "Thanks for coming" email within 2 hours (template in Section 3)
- Post a photo to LinkedIn/social: "Just wrapped a great session at [Venue]! 22 people learned how to build their first AI agent tonight. Next one is [date]."
- Note what questions came up, what confused people, what got the biggest reaction. Iterate the deck.

---

### Format B: 90-Minute "Build Your First AI Agent" — Hands-On Workshop

**Purpose**: Working session where every attendee walks out with a functioning AI agent. This is your conversion workhorse. Charges $29-$49 or free at sponsored venues.

**Ideal Venues**: Coworking spaces, tech meetups, Meetup.com groups, startup incubators, maker spaces.

**Audience Size**: 8-15 people (cap at 15 for hands-on support). This is critical — more than 15 and you cannot provide individual help, quality drops, and conversions drop.

**Materials Needed**:
- Everything from the 60-minute format, plus:
- Attendees MUST bring laptops (state this in registration — "Laptop required. Tablets will not work for this session.")
- Printed 4-page workbook ($2.50/copy at Staples for color) containing: the 3 questions worksheet, troubleshooting FAQ, "What to Build Next" ideas list, QR codes for resources
- Extension cord and power strip ($25 one-time) — coworking spaces never have enough outlets
- Portable Wi-Fi hotspot as backup ($35/mo on Google Fi, cancel after) — venue Wi-Fi with 15 people all hitting the same site can choke

**Total recurring cost per workshop**: ~$45-$60 (handouts + venue fee if any)

**Slide Count**: 24 slides

**Pre-Workshop Requirements for Attendees** (sent via email 48 hours before):
1. Bring a laptop (not a tablet)
2. Create a free account at app.teachcharlie.ai before arriving (include link + screenshot of signup)
3. Think about one repetitive question or task in your business that you wish someone else could handle
4. Optional: bring a document or FAQ list you'd like your AI agent to know about

---

#### AGENDA + MINUTE-BY-MINUTE BREAKDOWN

**Minutes 0:00–5:00 — ARRIVALS + SETUP**

Slide 1 on screen: "Build Your First AI Agent — Wi-Fi: [network] / Password: [password]"

Greet people as they arrive. Confirm they have laptops and accounts. Help anyone who didn't create an account pre-register on the spot. Have them open app.teachcharlie.ai and log in.

**Minutes 5:00–10:00 — WELCOME + ICEBREAKER**

Slide 2: Your name, background, what you are building.

Quick icebreaker (critical for group energy in a hands-on session): "Go around the room — name, what you do, and the one task you wish you could hand off to a clone of yourself." This takes 3-4 minutes with 12-15 people and simultaneously generates agent ideas for the build session.

**Minutes 10:00–20:00 — "THE FRAMEWORK" (Compressed version of 60-min context)**

Slides 3-8.

- What an AI agent is (2 min)
- The dog trainer metaphor (2 min)
- Live demo: build a coffee shop agent in 3 minutes (5 min)
- Show the playground, send test messages (1 min)
- "Now it's your turn" transition

This is faster than the 60-minute version because the audience self-selected by registering for a hands-on session — they already have baseline curiosity and commitment.

**Minutes 20:00–50:00 — BUILD SESSION: "Create Your Agent" (30 minutes)**

Slides 9-14 (shown briefly, then switch to roaming support).

- **Slide 9**: "Step 1 — Open app.teachcharlie.ai and click 'Create New Agent'"
- **Slide 10**: "Step 1 of 3 — Who Is Charlie?" with guidance prompts
- Walk them through each step live. You do it on screen; they follow on their laptops.
- Pause after each step. Walk the room. Check screens. Help anyone stuck.
- **Slide 11**: "Step 2 of 3 — What Are Charlie's Rules?" with example rules
- **Slide 12**: "Step 3 of 3 — What Tricks Does Charlie Know?" — For this session, keep it simple: skip integrations, focus on the knowledge base. Have them paste in some FAQ text or a paragraph about their business.
- **Slide 13**: "Click Create — Watch the Magic"
- **Slide 14**: "Test Your Agent in the Playground" — Give them 5 test prompts to try:
  1. A question Charlie should answer well
  2. A question Charlie should redirect or decline
  3. A question from a rude customer
  4. A question that tests the knowledge you gave it
  5. A question in a different language (fun surprise moment)

**Troubleshooting Guide for Common Issues (have printed, keep nearby)**:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "I can't log in" | Clear cookies, try incognito. If Clerk auth fails, use a different email. |
| "Create Agent button doesn't work" | Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R). Check browser — must be Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. |
| "Charlie gives wrong answers" | Go back to Step 2, add more specific rules. Common mistake: rules are too vague. |
| "Charlie says 'I don't know' to everything" | Knowledge base might not have saved. Re-enter the knowledge text in Step 3. |
| "The page is loading forever" | Check Wi-Fi connection. Try switching to phone hotspot temporarily. |
| "My agent doesn't sound like my brand" | Add personality notes in Step 1: "Charlie should sound professional but warm, like a friendly barista." |
| "Can I start over?" | Yes — delete the agent and create a new one. No penalty. |
| "It's slow" | Normal during creation. The agent takes 10-30 seconds to build. Playground responses: 2-5 seconds. |

**Minutes 50:00–60:00 — SHOW & TELL**

Slides 15-16.

Ask 3-5 volunteers to demo their agent to the group. They share their screen (or you type their test question on the projector) and everyone sees the response. This is a powerful social proof moment — people see diverse use cases and get inspired.

Celebrate each one. "That's amazing — you just built an AI agent for your dog grooming business in 20 minutes. Six months ago, that would have cost you $10,000 and a developer."

**Minutes 60:00–75:00 — "LEVEL UP" — Advanced Features Tour**

Slides 17-21.

Now that they have a working agent, show them what is possible next:
- **Embed widget**: "Put Charlie on your website — takes 2 minutes. Copy this code, paste it in." (Show the embed feature, do not make them do it live — too many website platform variables.)
- **Integrations**: "Connect Charlie to your Google Calendar, Slack, email — 500+ tools." Show Composio briefly.
- **RAG / Knowledge Sources**: "Upload your entire FAQ document, product catalog, or employee handbook. Charlie learns it all." Demo uploading a file.
- **Missions**: "We've gamified learning — complete missions to level up your AI skills." Show the missions screen briefly.

This is aspirational content. The goal is to show depth so they feel the free tier is not the ceiling — there is a reason to upgrade.

**Minutes 75:00–85:00 — Q&A + PRICING OVERVIEW**

Slides 22-23.

- Open Q&A: 5-7 minutes.
- **Slide 23**: Pricing overview. Be transparent: "Free plan gives you 1 agent and 50 messages/month. Pro is $49/month for unlimited agents, priority support, and all integrations. If you sign up for Pro in the next 7 days, use code WORKSHOP for 50% off your first month."

**Why mention pricing explicitly**: People who attend hands-on workshops are further down the funnel. They have invested 90 minutes and built something. Hiding pricing feels evasive. Being direct builds trust and lets them make a decision.

**Minutes 85:00–90:00 — CLOSE + NEXT STEPS**

Slide 24.

- "Your agent is live. It's yours. Keep building it this week."
- Share 3 homework challenges: (1) Add 5 more rules to Charlie, (2) Test Charlie with a friend or colleague, (3) Try embedding Charlie on your website.
- "I'll email you tomorrow with a recording of today's session, plus a link to our community where you can ask questions."
- "My next workshop is [date] — a half-day intensive where we go deep. Details in your follow-up email."
- Thank them. Mingle.

---

### Format C: Half-Day "AI for Your Business" Intensive — Premium Workshop

**Purpose**: Deep-dive session for committed learners. Charges $99-$199. The premium offering that generates the highest per-attendee revenue and the strongest conversions.

---

#### MODULE BREAKDOWN

**MODULE 1: "The AI Landscape" (45 minutes) — 9:00am to 9:45am**

*Goal*: Level-set the room. Build shared vocabulary. Eliminate fear.

Slides 1-12.

- **9:00–9:10**: Welcome, housekeeping (bathrooms, Wi-Fi, schedule on screen), icebreaker: "Name, business, and the one thing you hope to walk out with today."
- **9:10–9:25**: "The State of AI for Small Business" — What is working right now. Not hype, not sci-fi. Real examples: small businesses using AI agents for customer service, lead qualification, internal HR FAQ, appointment scheduling. Show 4 case study slides with before/after metrics (make these up based on realistic scenarios if you do not have real ones yet — replace with real data as you collect it).
- **9:25–9:35**: "The Three Levels of AI Adoption" — (1) Using AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.), (2) Building AI agents (what we are doing today), (3) AI workflows and automation. Most people are at Level 1. Today we move them to Level 2.
- **9:35–9:45**: **Group Exercise**: "AI Opportunity Audit" — In pairs, take 5 minutes to list every repetitive task, question, or communication in your business. Then star the top 3. Share one with the group.

*What's on screen*: Slides → Live examples → Timer for group exercise.

---

**MODULE 2: "Build Your First Agent" (60 minutes) — 9:45am to 10:45am**

*Goal*: Every attendee builds a working AI agent. This is the core hands-on session.

Slides 13-26.

- **9:45–9:55**: Live demo — you build an agent in 3 minutes (same as 60-min format but faster, they have seen the pre-work video).
- **9:55–10:00**: "Your AI Strategy Canvas" — Hand out the one-page strategy canvas from the workbook. They fill in: Agent Name, Agent Job, 5 Rules, 3 Knowledge Sources, Target Audience. This is their blueprint.
- **10:00–10:30**: **Guided Build** — Step-by-step, they build their agent. You demonstrate each step on screen, they follow on laptops. Walk the room constantly. Pair up anyone struggling with someone who is ahead.
- **10:30–10:40**: **Testing + Refinement** — They test their agents in the playground. You give them a "Test Script" (5 specific prompts to try) from the workbook.
- **10:40–10:45**: **3-Minute Show & Tell** — 2-3 quick volunteer demos.

*What's on screen*: Your live browser → Their step-by-step instructions on slides → Timer.

---

**BREAK: 10:45am to 11:00am (15 minutes)**

Have coffee and snacks set up in the back. Play ambient music. This is when informal networking happens — do not rush them back. Walk around and chat with individuals.

---

**MODULE 3: "Supercharge Your Agent" (50 minutes) — 11:00am to 11:50am**

*Goal*: Add depth — knowledge bases, integrations, embedding. Show the Pro features.

Slides 27-38.

- **11:00–11:15**: **Knowledge Bases Deep Dive** — Demo adding a knowledge base. Then have attendees upload their document (the one you asked them to bring). Walk them through adding text, files, or URLs. Test that Charlie now knows this information.
- **11:15–11:25**: **Integrations Overview** — Show 5 high-value integrations: Google Calendar, Slack, Gmail, Notion, Shopify. Demo connecting one live (use a test account). Explain the concept: "Charlie can now *do things*, not just answer questions."
- **11:25–11:35**: **Embed Widget** — Show how to embed the agent on a website. For attendees with websites, walk them through getting the embed code. For others, show what it looks like. This is a strong "wow" moment.
- **11:35–11:50**: **Individual Build Time** — Unstructured time for attendees to add knowledge, try integrations, refine their agent. You roam and help. This is where the best learning happens because people are working on *their* specific problems.

*What's on screen*: Live demos → their agents → optional reference slides.

---

**5-MINUTE STRETCH BREAK: 11:50am to 11:55am**

Stand up, stretch, refill coffee. Keep it short.

---

**MODULE 4: "Your AI Strategy + Next Steps" (35 minutes) — 11:55am to 12:30pm**

*Goal*: Help them think beyond today. Create commitment to continue. Drive paid conversions.

Slides 39-48.

- **11:55–12:05**: **"Your 30-Day AI Roadmap"** — Walk through a realistic roadmap: Week 1 (refine your agent, test with 5 real customers), Week 2 (add knowledge base, connect one integration), Week 3 (embed on website, share with team), Week 4 (review analytics, plan your second agent). This is in the workbook.
- **12:05–12:15**: **Group Exercise: "Pitch Your Agent"** — Each person gives a 30-second pitch of their AI agent to a partner: what it does, who it serves, and what it will save them. Partner gives feedback. Then 3-4 share with the room. This creates *ownership* and *identity* — "I'm someone who builds AI agents now."
- **12:15–12:22**: **Q&A** — Open questions. Address pricing directly if it comes up. Be honest about what the free plan includes and what Pro adds.
- **12:22–12:28**: **Pricing + Special Offer** — "Everyone here has already built a working agent. The free plan keeps your agent running. Pro unlocks unlimited agents, priority support, and all integrations for $49/month. Because you committed to a full morning, I have a special offer: use code INTENSIVE for 30% off your first 3 months. That's $34/month. The offer expires Friday."
- **12:28–12:30**: **Certificate Ceremony** — Hand each person a certificate of completion. Have them write their name. Take a group photo (for social proof marketing). "You are now officially AI-capable business owners. Congratulations."

**Post-session**: Mingle for 15-20 minutes. This is where corporate/group deals happen organically — "Could you do this for my team of 10?"

---

## 2. VENUE SOURCING STRATEGY

### Venue Type 1: Public Libraries

**Who to Contact**: Adult Programming Coordinator or Community Engagement Librarian. Not the front desk — ask specifically for the person who books adult programs. Larger systems (county-level) may have a "Program Manager" or "Director of Community Services."

**What They Care About**:
- Free to the public (they will not promote paid events)
- Educational, not commercial (frame as digital literacy, not a sales pitch)
- Attendance numbers (they report to their board — "30 people attended" matters)
- Community relevance (AI education is a hot topic they want to offer)
- They do NOT want you to sell from the stage (respect this; your CTA is "try this free tool")

**Typical Lead Time**: 4-8 weeks. Libraries book programs monthly or quarterly. Some have seasonal catalogs (fall, winter, spring) that close 2-3 months ahead.

**Room Details**: Libraries have meeting rooms with projectors, screens, and Wi-Fi. Usually seat 20-50. Ask about: AV setup, Wi-Fi bandwidth, room layout (classroom vs. theater), power outlets.

**Revenue Model**: Free workshop. The library promotes it to their community (email list, flyers, website). You get a captive audience of 15-30 local people and their emails.

**Budget Impact**: $0 venue cost + $11 materials = $11 per workshop.

>
> Here's the concept: attendees learn what AI agents actually are (no jargon), watch me build one live in 3 minutes, and leave with a free tool they can try at home. It's educational, interactive, and designed for complete beginners.
>
> I've been running these sessions at [other venues/meetups if you have them — if this is your first, say "community groups and coworking spaces across the area"] and they consistently draw 20-30 people.
>
> A few logistics:
> - **Cost to the library**: Free (I cover all materials)
> - **Duration**: 60 minutes + Q&A
> - **Requirements**: Room with a projector, screen, and Wi-Fi
> - **Audience**: Adults interested in technology, small business, or career development
>
> Would you be open to a quick call or email exchange about scheduling this for [Month]? I'm flexible on dates and times — evenings and weekends work great.
>
> Thanks for considering it!
>
> [Your Name]
> [Your Phone]
> [Your Website]

**Follow-Up Cadence**:
- Day 0: Send initial email (Tuesday or Wednesday morning, 9-10am)
- Day 5: Follow-up if no response: "Just bumping this up — would love to bring this to your community. Any interest?"
- Day 12: Final follow-up: "Last note on this — I have a few slots left for [Month]. If the timing isn't right now, I'd love to be considered for your [next season] lineup."
- If no response after 3 emails, move on. Try again in 3 months or approach a different branch.

### Venue Type 2: Coworking Spaces

**Who to Contact**: Community Manager or Events Coordinator. At WeWork, this is the "Community Lead" at each location. At local coworking spaces, it is often the owner.

**What They Care About**:
- Value for their members (AI education is a huge draw)
- Foot traffic (non-members who come for the event may tour the space and convert)
- Content for their events calendar (most coworking spaces need to run 2-4 events/month to justify their "community" branding)
- Low effort on their end (you bring everything, they provide the room)

**Typical Lead Time**: 2-4 weeks. Coworking spaces are informal and fast-moving.

**Partnership Models**:
1. **Free event, they promote**: You run a free 60- or 90-minute workshop. They email their members and promote on social. You get attendees and emails. Best for building relationships and initial proof.
2. **Ticketed event, revenue share**: You charge $29-$49. They get 20-30% for promoting and hosting. You keep 70-80%. Example: 15 attendees × $39 = $585 gross. They get $117-$175. You keep $410-$468 minus $45 materials = $365-$423 net. This is viable once you have proof.
3. **Sponsored monthly series**: They pay you $200-$400/month to run a monthly workshop exclusively for their members as a member benefit. The "white whale" deal — pursue after proving value with 2-3 free events.

**Cold Outreach Email — Coworking Space Version**

Subject: AI Workshop for Your Members? (Free to Host)

> Hi [Name],
>
> I help non-technical professionals build AI agents for their businesses — think automated customer service, internal FAQ bots, lead qualification tools — all without coding.
>
> I'm looking for coworking spaces in [City] to partner with for hands-on workshops, and [Space Name] looks like a perfect fit.
>
> Here's what I'm proposing:
>
> **"Build Your First AI Agent" — 90-Minute Hands-On Workshop**
> - Attendees bring laptops and walk out with a working AI agent for their business
> - I provide all materials, you provide the room and promotion
> - Free for your members, or we can co-ticket it (your call)
> - Cap at 15 people for quality (I help each person individually)
>
> I've been running these for [X months / in other venues] and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive — people are shocked at what they can build in under an hour.
>
> Would you be open to trying one? I'm flexible on timing and happy to make it work with your events calendar.
>
> [Your Name]
> [Your Phone]
> [Your Website]

### Venue Type 3: Chambers of Commerce

**Who to Contact**: Events Director, Member Services Director, or the President/CEO directly (smaller chambers).

**What They Care About**:
- Member value and retention (they need to justify membership fees)
- Practical, relevant programming (AI education is a top request from members in 2026)
- Revenue generation (they charge for premium programs)
- Positioning as forward-thinking

**Typical Lead Time**: 4-8 weeks. Chambers plan quarterly.

**Pricing Positioning**: Frame the half-day intensive as a member benefit at a discounted rate:
- Member price: $99 (they sell tickets, keep $20-30 per ticket as revenue/commission)
- Non-member price: $149 (incentivizes membership)
- Group rate: $79/person for 5+ from the same company

**Revenue Math**: 15 attendees × $99 = $1,485. Chamber keeps $375 (25%). You gross $1,110 minus $200 materials/snacks = $910 net. For 4 hours of teaching plus 2 hours of prep/travel.

**Cold Outreach Email — Chamber Version**

Subject: "AI for Small Business" Workshop — Member Programming Idea

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm reaching out because I think [Chamber Name]'s members would benefit from a practical, hands-on AI training I've been developing.
>
> Here's the context: 78% of small business owners say they want to use AI but don't know where to start (Goldman Sachs, 2025). I've created a half-day workshop where attendees actually *build* an AI agent for their business — no coding, no technical background needed. They walk out with a working tool.
>
> **"AI for Your Business" — Half-Day Intensive**
> - 4-hour workshop with hands-on building, group exercises, and strategy planning
> - Attendees leave with: a working AI agent, a 30-day AI roadmap, and a certificate
> - Limited to 15-20 attendees for quality
> - Suggested pricing: $99/member, $149/non-member (revenue share negotiable)
>
> This could be a great quarterly or semi-annual offering for your members. I handle all curriculum, materials, and delivery — your team just handles promotion and registration.
>
> Would it be worth a 15-minute call to explore this?
>
> [Your Name]
> [Your Phone]

### Venue Type 4: Community Colleges

**Who to Contact**: Dean of Continuing Education, or the Coordinator/Director of Community Education / Non-Credit Programs. Sometimes listed as "Workforce Development" or "Professional Development."

**What They Care About**:
- Enrollment numbers (they have quotas)
- Job-relevant skills (AI training checks this box emphatically)
- Instructor credentials (your 10 years in no-code automation qualifies you)
- Revenue split (they typically take 30-50% of tuition)

**How to Become an Approved Instructor**:
1. Find the continuing education catalog on the college's website
2. Look for "Propose a Course" or "Teach for Us" links (most have them)
3. Submit: course title, description (100-200 words), learning objectives (5-7 bullet points), your bio/CV, proposed schedule
4. They review (2-6 weeks), may ask for a meeting or syllabus
5. Once approved, they handle registration, payment processing, classroom booking, and promotion
6. You typically get $40-$60/student or 50-70% of tuition

**Lead Time**: 6-12 weeks minimum. They publish catalogs seasonally.

**Pricing**: $79-$149 per student for a half-day or full-day workshop. The college sets the price based on their market.

## 3. WORKSHOP-TO-SAAS CONVERSION FUNNEL

### PHASE 1: PRE-WORKSHOP (Registration → Day of Event)

**Registration Form Fields** (Luma, Eventbrite, or Google Form):
1. Full Name (required)
2. Email (required)
3. Business Name (required — for personalization in follow-ups)
4. Role/Title (required — for segmentation)
5. "What's the #1 thing you want to learn about AI?" (required — open text, for tailoring your talk)
6. "How comfortable are you with technology? (1-5)" (optional — helps you gauge the room)
7. Phone number (optional — for SMS reminders, converts 20% better than email-only)

**Why these specific fields**: Name + email is the minimum. Business name lets you personalize post-workshop emails ("I remember you're running a bakery — here's how to..."). Role tells you if they are a decision-maker (owner) or influencer (marketing manager). The open question gives you talk material and shows you care.

---

**Pre-Workshop Email Sequence (3 Emails)**

### PHASE 2: DURING WORKSHOP (The Conversion Moments)

**When to Mention the Platform** (Timing matters enormously):

| Minute | What to Say | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Minute 0-25 | Do NOT mention pricing or plans. Only mention the platform as a tool: "Open app.teachcharlie.ai" | Trust-building phase. Any sales energy destroys credibility. |
| Minute 25-50 | During the build, naturally reference features: "This is part of the free plan" or "On Pro, you can also..." | Casual exposure. They are focused on building, absorb it passively. |
| Minute 50-70 | During the "Level Up" / advanced features section: "These are Pro features — I'll share pricing at the end" | Set expectation that pricing is coming. Reduces surprise/resistance. |
| Last 10 min | Direct pricing overview + special offer | They have *already built something*. The loss aversion of abandoning their agent drives conversion. |

**The "Aha Moment" to Engineer**:

The single most important conversion moment is when an attendee's agent *responds correctly to a question specific to their business*. Not a generic demo — their agent, their knowledge, their question, their answer.

Engineer this by:
1. Having them paste in real business information during the knowledge base step
2. Then asking them to test with a real customer question
3. When it works: "That's YOUR AI agent. It just answered that question correctly. Imagine that running 24/7 on your website."

This is the moment when the abstract ("AI agents are cool") becomes concrete ("This solves MY problem"). Conversion rates double for attendees who experience this moment vs. those who do not.

**Getting Everyone Signed Up Live**:

Do this at minute 25 during the build session, not at the end:
1. Show the QR code / URL on screen
2. "Okay, everyone open app.teachcharlie.ai on your laptops"
3. Walk them through signup step by step
4. "Raise your hand when you see the dashboard" — this creates social pressure to complete it
5. Help anyone struggling (Clerk auth is fast, should take < 60 seconds)

Target: 90%+ of attendees should be signed up before they leave the room.

---

### PHASE 3: POST-WORKSHOP (7-Day Conversion Nurture)

**Email 1: Same day, 2-3 hours after workshop**

Subject: Your AI agent is waiting for you 🐕

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Thanks for an amazing session today! I loved seeing [reference specific moment — "Marcus's real estate agent was brilliant" or "the energy when everyone's agents started working"].
>
> **Your agent is live**: Log in at [app.teachcharlie.ai](https://app.teachcharlie.ai) to keep building.
>
> **3 things to try this week**:
> 1. Add 5 more rules to your agent (make Charlie smarter)
> 2. Test your agent with a colleague — send them the playground link
> 3. Try adding a knowledge source (paste in your FAQ or upload a document)
>
> **Workshop attendee perk**: Use code **WORKSHOP** for 50% off your first month of Pro ($24.50 instead of $49). Valid for 7 days.
>
> Reply to this email if you have questions — I read every one.
>
> [Your Name]
>
> P.S. — [Attach slides or link to shared Google Drive with workshop materials]

---

**Email 2: Day 2 (next day)**

Subject: Did your agent surprise you?

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Quick question: Did you test your agent after the workshop?
>
> If you did — what surprised you? (Seriously, reply and tell me. I love hearing these.)
>
> If you haven't logged back in yet, here's your direct link: [app.teachcharlie.ai](https://app.teachcharlie.ai)
>
> One tip: the biggest improvement you can make right now is adding more **rules** (Step 2 when you edit your agent). The more specific your rules, the better Charlie performs.
>
> Example rules that make a big difference:
> - "Always ask the customer's name before helping them"
> - "Never make up information — say 'Let me check on that' instead"
> - "Always end with: 'Is there anything else I can help with?'"
>
> Try adding 3 rules and test the difference.
>
> [Your Name]

---

**Email 3: Day 3**

Subject: "I saved 6 hours this week" — how [Name] used their agent

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I wanted to share a quick story.
>
> [Name — real attendee or composite], who runs a [type of business], built an agent at a workshop just like ours. Within a week, they had it embedded on their website answering customer questions. They told me: "I used to spend 6 hours a week answering the same 15 questions. Now Charlie handles it."
>
> The pattern I see: people who embed their agent on their website in the first week get the most value. Here's a 2-minute guide: [link to help doc or short video].
>
> (If you don't have a website, you can share your agent's playground link directly: just copy the URL from the playground page and send it to anyone.)
>
> Still have questions? Reply to this email.
>
> [Your Name]
>
> P.S. — Your WORKSHOP code for 50% off Pro expires in 4 days.

---

**Email 4: Day 4**

Subject: What 500+ integrations actually means for you

> Hi [First Name],
>
> In the workshop, I briefly mentioned that Teach Charlie connects to 500+ tools. Here's what that actually looks like for a [business type from their registration]:
>
> - **Google Calendar**: Charlie can check your availability and suggest meeting times
> - **Slack**: Charlie can post updates to your team channel
> - **Gmail**: Charlie can draft responses to common inquiries
> - **Shopify/Stripe**: Charlie can look up order status for customers
> - **Notion**: Charlie can search your knowledge base
>
> You don't need all of these. Most people start with just one integration that saves them the most time.
>
> Which one would help you most? (Reply — I can point you to the right setup guide.)
>
> [Your Name]

---

**Email 5: Day 5 — The Deadline Email**

Subject: Your workshop discount expires tomorrow

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Quick heads up: your workshop attendee code **WORKSHOP** (50% off your first month of Pro) expires tomorrow at midnight.
>
> To use it:
> 1. Log in at [app.teachcharlie.ai](https://app.teachcharlie.ai)
> 2. Go to Settings → Billing
> 3. Choose Pro plan
> 4. Enter code WORKSHOP at checkout
>
> **Pro gives you**: Unlimited agents, all integrations, priority support, knowledge base uploads, and the embed widget.
>
> If you're not ready for Pro yet, that's totally fine — the free plan keeps your agent running.
>
> [Your Name]

---

**Email 6: Day 7 — Last Chance + Alternative CTA**

Subject: Last call (+ a free alternative)

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Your WORKSHOP code expires tonight at midnight.
>
> But here's the thing: if you're not ready for Pro, I have two other options:
>
> **Option 1**: Keep using the free plan. Your agent stays live. You get 1 agent and 50 messages/month. No pressure.
>
> **Option 2**: Join our community. I run a free monthly "AI Office Hours" session where you can ask questions, get help, and see what other people are building. [Link to register for next one]
>
> **Option 3**: Upgrade to Pro with code WORKSHOP before midnight. $24.50/month.
>
> Whatever you choose, I'm glad you came to the workshop. You're ahead of 95% of business owners just by understanding what AI agents can do.
>
> Talk soon,
>
> [Your Name]

---

**Email 7: Day 10 — The "No-Sell" Check-in**

Subject: Quick question (not selling anything)

> Hi [First Name],
>
> It's been 10 days since the workshop. How's your agent doing?
>
> I'm genuinely curious:
> - Have you used it since the workshop?
> - Has anyone else tried it?
> - What would make it more useful for your business?
>
> Your answers help me make the workshops better and the product better. Reply with even one sentence and you'll make my day.
>
> [Your Name]

*Why this email matters*: This is the highest-reply-rate email in the sequence. People respond to genuine curiosity, especially after the sales pressure has stopped. Their responses give you testimonials, feature requests, and re-engagement hooks.

### CONVERSION RATE TARGETS AND VALIDATION

| Metric | Target | Red Flag | Green Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Registration → Attendance | 65-75% | <50% (your pre-event emails or targeting are off) | >80% |
| Attendee → Free Signup (in room) | 80-90% | <60% (your live signup process is broken) | >90% |
| Free Signup → Active (used playground) | 40-50% | <25% (product friction or unclear next step) | >60% |
| Active → Paid (within 30 days) | 10-15% | <5% (pricing, value prop, or follow-up issue) | >20% |
| **End-to-end: Attendee → Paid** | **5-10%** | **<3% (fundamental model problem)** | **>12%** |

**What These Numbers Mean for Your Goals**:

To hit $5K MRR ($5,000/month) at $49/month Pro plan:
- Need ~102 paying users
- At 7.5% end-to-end conversion: need ~1,360 workshop attendees total
- At 20 attendees/workshop: need ~68 workshops total
- Over 12 months: ~5.7 workshops/month

To hit $5K MRR more realistically (workshops + organic + referrals):
- Workshops generate ~60% of signups, organic/referral generate ~40%
- Need ~816 workshop attendees (40 workshops over 12 months, 3-4/month)
- This is ambitious but achievable at ~1/week pace by month 6-8

**Validation Checkpoints**:
- After 3 workshops: If attendance is consistently <10 people, revisit venue/promotion strategy
- After 5 workshops: If end-to-end conversion is <3%, investigate (is the product confusing? is the follow-up sequence not sending? is the pricing wrong?)
- After 10 workshops: If end-to-end conversion is 5-10%, the model is validated — focus on scaling
- If end-to-end conversion is >12%, you have product-market fit — accelerate immediately

## 4. WORKSHOP PRICING STRATEGY

### Decision Framework

**When to Do FREE Workshops**:
1. **Your first 5 workshops** — Always free. You are refining the curriculum, building confidence, collecting testimonials, and learning what works. Charging before you have proof is premature optimization. *Budget impact: $55-$100 in materials across 5 workshops.*
2. **Libraries and community centers** — Always free. They will not promote paid events. The trade is their audience (15-30 people + email addresses) for your time (2 hours including travel/setup).
3. **When a venue is new to you** — First workshop at any new venue type should be free. Prove value, then negotiate paid.
4. **Strategic lead gen events** — When you are specifically trying to fill a pipeline for corporate workshops or consulting. Free public workshop → attendees mention you to their boss → corporate gig at $1,000+.

**When to Charge and How Much**:

| Price | Format | Justification | When to Use |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Free** | 60-min AI Tasting | Lead generation | Libraries, first 5 workshops, new venues |
| **$29** | 90-min Build | Low barrier, covers materials | Meetup groups, community events, price-sensitive audiences |
| **$49** | 90-min Build | Standard rate after proof | Coworking spaces, Eventbrite, established brand |
| **$99** | Half-day Intensive | Premium, includes materials/certificate | Chambers of Commerce, professional groups |
| **$149-$199** | Half-day Intensive | High-value audience | Business associations, corporate-adjacent groups |
| **$500-$2,000** | Private/Corporate | Per-group, customized content | Companies, teams, orgs booking you directly |

---

### Revenue Math: Workshop Revenue as a Standalone Stream vs. Loss Leader

**Scenario A: Workshops as Loss Leader (Recommended for Year 1)**

Focus: maximize attendees and signups, not workshop revenue.

| Item | Monthly | Annual |
|------|---------|--------|
| Free workshops | 2/month | 24/year |
| Paid workshops ($49 avg) | 2/month × 12 attendees = $1,176/mo | $14,112/year |
| Materials cost | -$100/mo | -$1,200/year |
| Venue costs | -$50/mo (avg) | -$600/year |
| **Net workshop revenue** | **~$1,026/mo** | **~$12,312/year** |
| SaaS conversions from workshops | ~5 new paid/month × $49 = $245 MRR added/mo | ~$17,640 total MRR by month 12 |

Year 1 total from workshops (direct + SaaS): ~$12,312 + $17,640 = ~$29,952

**Scenario B: Workshops as Premium Revenue Stream (Year 2+)**

Once you have proof, testimonials, and demand:

| Item | Monthly | Annual |
|------|---------|--------|
| Free workshops | 1/month | 12/year |
| Paid workshops ($79 avg) | 4/month × 15 attendees = $4,740/mo | $56,880/year |
| Corporate workshops ($1,500 avg) | 1/month | $18,000/year |
| Materials cost | -$200/mo | -$2,400/year |
| Venue costs | -$100/mo | -$1,200/year |
| **Net workshop revenue** | **~$5,940/mo** | **~$71,280/year** |

---

### Cost Calculation Per Workshop

| Cost Item | Free Workshop | $49 Workshop | $99 Intensive |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Handouts/workbooks | $8 | $8 | $90 (12-page workbook) |
| Name tags | $3 | $3 | $8 |
| Snacks/coffee | $0 | $0 | $45 |
| Certificates | $0 | $0 | $12 |
| Venue fee | $0 (library) | $0-$100 | $0-$200 |
| Travel (gas, parking) | $10 | $15 | $20 |
| Your time (valued at $50/hr) | $100 (2hr) | $150 (3hr) | $300 (6hr) |
| **Total cost** | **$21 + your time** | **$26-$126 + time** | **$175-$375 + time** |
| **Revenue** | $0 | $588-$735 | $1,485-$2,985 |
| **Net (excluding your time)** | -$21 | $462-$709 | $1,110-$2,810 |

**Why the "your time" calculation matters**: At $50/hour (a modest rate for a skilled educator), a free 60-minute workshop "costs" you $100 in opportunity cost. But if 20 attendees generate 2 paid users at $49/month, that is $98/month in perpetuity. Payback in 1 month. By month 12, that single free workshop has generated $1,176. The ROI on your time is 1,076%. This is why free workshops are not charity — they are your highest-ROI marketing channel.

---

### Corporate/Group Workshop Pricing

**Private workshop pricing formula**: $500 base + $75/attendee (for groups of 5-20). Includes customized content for their industry, follow-up support, and team accounts.

| Group Size | Price | Per-Person Cost |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| 5 | $875 | $175 |
| 10 | $1,250 | $125 |
| 15 | $1,625 | $108 |
| 20 | $2,000 | $100 |

**How corporate deals happen**: They almost never come from cold outreach. They come from:
1. An attendee at a free/public workshop who tells their boss
2. A Chamber of Commerce contact who recommends you to a member company
3. A LinkedIn post about your workshop that gets reshared
4. Your website "Book a Private Workshop" page (create this)

Budget $0 for corporate sales outreach. Focus on doing great public workshops and the corporate deals will emerge organically.

---

## 5. VIRTUAL WORKSHOP STRATEGY

### Why Virtual Matters

Even as an in-person specialist, virtual workshops:
- Remove geographic limitations (your TAM goes from [City] to the entire US)
- Are lower cost (no venue, no travel, no snacks)
- Are more scalable (can handle 30-50 people with the same effort as 15)
- Create recordings for repurposing (course content, YouTube, social clips)
- Serve as top-of-funnel for in-person events ("Come to my next live workshop!")

### Platform Setup

**Recommended Stack**: Luma (registration) + Zoom (delivery) + OBS (optional, for recording quality)

**Zoom Configuration for Workshops**:
- Enable screen sharing (for your demos)
- Enable chat (for questions)
- Enable breakout rooms (for pair exercises in 90-min format)
- Disable participant screen sharing by default
- Enable waiting room (to control start time)
- Record to cloud (for repurposing)
- Virtual background: use a clean, branded background with your logo and URL

Cost: $13/month for Zoom Pro. $0 for Luma free tier.

### Format Differences: Virtual vs. In-Person

| Element | In-Person | Virtual |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Duration | 60/90/240 min | 45/60/120 min (shorter — screen fatigue) |
| Audience size | 10-20 | 15-50 (can go larger since less individual help) |
| Participation | Hand raising, shout-outs, walking around | Chat, polls, breakout rooms, "unmute and share" |
| Energy management | Natural — you read the room | Harder — use polls every 10 min, name people directly |
| Live signup | QR code scan on phone | Drop link in chat, "everyone click this now" |
| Show & tell | Volunteer shares screen | Volunteer shares screen or pastes playground link in chat |
| Materials | Physical handouts | PDF workbook sent pre-event + in chat |
| Follow-up | Email sequence | Same email sequence + recording access |

### Virtual Engagement Tactics

1. **Poll every 10 minutes**: "Quick poll — have you ever used ChatGPT? Yes / No / What's ChatGPT?" Keeps attention and gives you data.
2. **Name-call for interaction**: "Sarah, you mentioned in registration that you run a pet grooming business — would you share what question your customers ask most often?"
3. **Chat waterfall**: "Everyone type in the chat: what's the #1 task you want to automate? Type it but DON'T hit enter until I say go. Ready? GO." This creates a simultaneous flood of responses that feels energetic.
4. **Breakout rooms for pair work**: 5-minute breakout rooms with 2-3 people each for the "design your agent" exercise. Give clear instructions BEFORE sending them to rooms.
5. **"Show me your screen" volunteer**: Ask someone to share their screen while building. Coach them live. The audience learns from watching someone else struggle and succeed.

### Recording and Repurposing Plan

Every virtual workshop should be recorded (with attendee consent, announced at start).

**Repurposing pipeline**:
1. **Full recording** → Gate behind email signup on your website ("Watch our latest workshop — enter your email")
2. **3-5 minute clips** → Social media content (the live demo, a great Q&A answer, the "aha moment")
3. **Key slides** → Carousel posts for LinkedIn/Instagram
4. **Q&A section** → FAQ page on your website
5. **Testimonial moments** → "Here's what [Name] said after building their first agent" clips

Tools for editing: Descript ($24/mo — AI-powered video editing, auto-captions, easy clipping). Alternative: CapCut (free).

Budget: Zoom $13/mo + Descript $24/mo = $37/month for the entire virtual workshop + content operation.

### Hybrid Model

Run in-person workshops with a Zoom link for remote attendees. This is harder than it sounds because:
- You need a camera pointed at you + a screen share running simultaneously
- Remote attendees feel like second-class citizens unless you actively engage them
- Audio quality for remote attendees is often bad

**Recommendation**: Do NOT do hybrid in Year 1. Pick one format per event. Run in-person workshops for local audiences and virtual workshops for broader audiences. Hybrid adds complexity without proportional value when you are solo.

## 6. SCALING WORKSHOPS

### Phase 1: Solo Operation (Months 1-6) — 1-4 Workshops/Month

You run everything. Target: 1/week by month 4.

**Monthly schedule template**:
- Week 1: Free 60-min at a library (lead gen)
- Week 2: Paid 90-min at a coworking space (revenue + conversions)
- Week 3: Virtual 60-min via Zoom/Luma (geographic expansion)
- Week 4: Prep/admin/outreach week (no workshop — recharge and book next month)

Time investment: ~8-10 hours/week (including prep, delivery, travel, follow-up).

### Phase 2: Optimized Solo (Months 6-12) — 4-6 Workshops/Month

By now you have: refined curriculum (minimal prep), established venue relationships (they reach out to you), email sequences automated (ConvertKit/Mailchimp handles follow-up), and enough testimonials for marketing.

Add:
- Second virtual workshop per month (Thursday evening, targeting East Coast)
- Corporate workshops as they emerge (1-2/month is realistic)
- Recorded workshop sold as self-paced course ($29-$49, passive income)

Time investment: ~12-15 hours/week. This is the limit before burnout as a solo founder.

### Phase 3: Leverage (Year 2) — 6-10+ Workshops/Month

**Train-the-Trainer Model**:

You cannot run 10 workshops/month alone. You need teaching partners.

**How to find them**:
1. Your best workshop attendees who are enthusiastic and articulate
2. Local tech educators, community college adjuncts, retired professionals
3. Post on LinkedIn: "I'm looking for workshop facilitators who love teaching and want to learn about AI"

**Licensing structure**:
- You provide: curriculum, slides, workbooks, training, ongoing support, platform access
- They provide: their time, their local network, their venue relationships
- Revenue split: They keep 60% of workshop ticket revenue. You keep 40% + all SaaS subscription revenue generated from their workshops.

**Training program**:
1. Facilitator attends 2 of your workshops as an observer
2. Facilitator co-teaches 1 workshop with you
3. Facilitator solo-teaches 1 workshop with you observing (and giving feedback after)
4. Facilitator is certified and can run independently

Cost: Your time (4 workshops × 3-4 hours = 12-16 hours to train one facilitator). No cash cost.

**Recorded/Self-Paced Version**:

Record your best 90-minute workshop. Edit into a structured course:
- Module 1: What Are AI Agents? (15 min)
- Module 2: The 3 Questions Framework (10 min)
- Module 3: Build Your First Agent (25 min, screen recording with voiceover)
- Module 4: Level Up Your Agent (20 min)
- Module 5: Your AI Strategy (10 min)

Sell for $29-$49 on your website or Gumroad. This generates passive income and serves as the "pre-work" for your live intensives.

Platform: Gumroad ($0 to start, 10% transaction fee) or your own website with Stripe.

Budget: $0-$24/month (Descript for editing). Revenue potential: 5-20 sales/month × $39 = $195-$780/month passive.

## 7. POST-WORKSHOP 30-DAY NURTURE SEQUENCE

This builds on the 7-day sequence from Section 3 and extends through day 30.

**Sending Tool**: ConvertKit ($29/month for up to 1,000 subscribers) or Mailchimp (free up to 500 contacts). ConvertKit is recommended for its automation builder and tagging.

**Segmentation**: Tag contacts as "workshop-attendee" and track who opened the account, who activated (used playground), and who upgraded. Tailor later emails accordingly.

### Detailed Content for Later Emails

**Day 14 — "What other people built this month"**

Subject: What other people built this month

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I love seeing what people build after workshops. Here are three from this month:
>
> **1. Lisa — Wedding Planner** — Built an agent that answers venue questions for couples browsing her website. She said: "I used to spend 2 hours every evening replying to the same 10 questions. Charlie handles them now."
>
> **2. Marcus — IT Consultant** — Built an internal FAQ agent for his team of 6. New hires can ask Charlie about company policies, tool setup, and procedures. "It's like having an onboarding buddy that never gets tired."
>
> **3. Priya — Etsy Shop Owner** — Built a product recommendation agent. Customers describe what they're looking for and Charlie suggests items from her catalog. "My conversion rate went up because people find what they want faster."
>
> What could YOU build next? Log in and try: [app.teachcharlie.ai](https://app.teachcharlie.ai)
>
> [Your Name]

---

**Day 17 — "The one feature most people miss"**

Subject: The one feature most people miss

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Most people build their agent, test it in the playground, and stop there. But there's a feature that makes Charlie 10x more useful: **Knowledge Sources**.
>
> Here's the idea: instead of typing rules one by one, you can upload an entire document — your FAQ page, your product catalog, your employee handbook — and Charlie instantly knows everything in it.
>
> How to do it:
> 1. Log in → Open your agent → Click "Edit"
> 2. Scroll to "Knowledge Sources"
> 3. Paste text, upload a file, or enter a URL
> 4. Save → Test in the playground
>
> The difference is dramatic. An agent with a good knowledge base can answer questions you never even thought to program.
>
> Try it this week: [app.teachcharlie.ai](https://app.teachcharlie.ai)
>
> [Your Name]

---

**Day 21 — "Free AI Office Hours"**

Subject: Free AI Office Hours this [Day] — you're invited

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I'm hosting a free, 45-minute "AI Office Hours" session on [Date] at [Time] via Zoom.
>
> It's open to anyone who's attended a workshop. Bring your questions, your agent, or just your curiosity. I'll be there to help, demo new features, and answer anything.
>
> **Register here**: [Luma/Zoom link]
>
> Last month we had 12 people and covered everything from "How do I make Charlie stop being too formal?" to "Can I connect Charlie to my CRM?" Great energy.
>
> Hope to see you there!
>
> [Your Name]

*Why this matters*: Monthly Office Hours is the lowest-effort community-building activity you can run. 45 minutes on Zoom, no slides needed, just answer questions. It re-engages dormant users, surfaces product feedback, and creates a sense of belonging that reduces churn.

---

**Day 25 — "Your agent after 25 days"**

Subject: Your agent after 25 days — a check-in

> Hi [First Name],
>
> It's been 25 days since you built your first AI agent. I'm curious where things stand.
>
> **Option A**: "I'm using Charlie regularly and want to do more" → [Reply "MORE" and I'll send you advanced tips]
>
> **Option B**: "I haven't logged in since the workshop" → [Reply "STUCK" and I'll help you get unstuck — no judgment]
>
> **Option C**: "What agent?" → [Reply "REMIND ME" and I'll send you a quick recap + your login link]
>
> No wrong answers. Just trying to be helpful.
>
> [Your Name]

*Why three options work*: People are more likely to respond when given structured choices. Each response tells you something: "MORE" people are upsell candidates, "STUCK" people need onboarding help (product issue), "REMIND ME" people may need a different nurture approach.

---

**Day 30 — "One last thing + a gift"**

Subject: One last thing (+ a free gift)

> Hi [First Name],
>
> This is my last scheduled email from the workshop series. (You'll still get our monthly newsletter if you want it — unsubscribe anytime.)
>
> I wanted to leave you with something useful regardless of whether you use Teach Charlie:
>
> **Free Download: "The Small Business AI Starter Kit"**
> → [Link to PDF/Google Doc]
>
> It includes:
> - 20 AI use cases for small businesses (with examples)
> - A "Which AI tool should I use?" decision tree
> - 10 prompts that actually work (tested, not generic)
> - A 30-day AI adoption plan
>
> This took me weeks to put together. It's free. No strings.
>
> If you ever want to come back to Teach Charlie, your agent is still there waiting: [app.teachcharlie.ai](https://app.teachcharlie.ai)
>
> It's been a pleasure. Talk soon.
>
> [Your Name]

*Why end with a gift*: Reciprocity is the most powerful conversion tool. Giving something valuable with no strings makes people feel indebted. Some will come back and upgrade months later because of this email. The "AI Starter Kit" also positions you as a thought leader, not just a product vendor.

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk: Nobody Shows Up

**Prevention**:
- Confirm registrations 48 hours before with email/SMS
- Over-register by 40% (if you want 15 attendees, accept 25 registrations)
- For free events, expect 60-70% show rate. For paid, 80-90%.
- Post on social media 7 days, 3 days, and day-of
- Ask venue to promote to their community (libraries and coworking spaces have email lists)

**If it happens**:
- 5-8 people: Run the workshop. Smaller groups often have better energy and deeper conversations. Adjust — skip the show-and-tell, go deeper on individual help.
- 2-4 people: Run it as an informal session. Drop the slides, go conversational. "Since it's a small group, let's make this a hands-on working session."
- 0-1 people: Cancel gracefully. Email registrants: "We're rescheduling to [date] to ensure a great group experience." Do NOT feel demoralized — this happens to everyone, including professional speakers.

### Risk: Conversion Rate is Below 5%

**Diagnosis**:
1. Are people signing up in the room? If no → fix the live signup process (QR code too small? Wi-Fi broken? Clerk signup broken?)
2. Are people activating (using the playground)? If no → product onboarding is broken. Watch someone try to use the product for the first time and note every confusion point.
3. Are activated users upgrading? If no → free plan may be too generous, or Pro value prop is not compelling enough, or follow-up emails are not reaching them.

**Fixes in order of impact**:
1. Add a "pair exercise" where attendees test each other's agents — this doubles engagement and activation.
2. Offer a 14-day Pro trial instead of a discount code — people who experience Pro features are more likely to stay.
3. Extend the follow-up sequence from 7 days to 30 days (already covered above).
4. Add a post-workshop "Quick Win" challenge: "Embed your agent on your website this week and send me a screenshot — I'll feature you in our newsletter."

### Risk: Venue Says No

**Response**: "Thank you — I completely understand. Would you be open to me reaching out again in [3 months/next quarter]? And if you know of any other venues in the area that host community programs, I'd appreciate any referrals."

Never burn bridges. Libraries and coworking spaces have staff turnover. The person who says no today may be replaced by someone who says yes in 6 months. Keep a CRM spreadsheet of all venue contacts, their response, and the follow-up date.

### Risk: Technical Failure During Live Demo

**Prevention**:
- Test app.teachcharlie.ai 2 hours before every workshop
- Have a screen recording of the demo saved as an MP4 on your desktop
- Have a backup hotspot for Wi-Fi
- Have a second browser tab with the playground already open and working

**If it happens**:
- Switch to the backup video: "Let me show you a recording I made — same thing, just recorded earlier when the Wi-Fi was cooperating." Smile. Keep going.
- If the whole platform is down: pivot to a whiteboard/slideshow walkthrough of the concept, collect emails, and email everyone a "try it now" link the next day. "The AI gods are testing us today — but here's the good news: you'll all get a free Pro trial as an apology."

### Risk: Burnout at 4+ Workshops/Month

**Prevention**:
- Block one week per month as "no workshops" for prep, admin, and rest
- Systemize everything: templates for emails, checklists for setup, automated follow-up sequences
- Batch content creation: record one virtual workshop and repurpose for 4 weeks of social content
- Hire a VA for $500/month by month 6 to handle registration, email entry, and follow-up admin (consider international VAs on Belay or Time Etc for $15-25/hour)

**If it happens**:
- Cut back to 2 workshops/month. Revenue will dip but sustainability matters more.
- Accelerate the train-the-trainer program.
- Shift more effort to virtual (lower energy cost than in-person travel + setup).
