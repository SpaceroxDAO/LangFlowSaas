### Phase 12: Knowledge Sources & RAG Foundation ✅ Complete

**Goal**: Enable users to add knowledge sources (text, files, URLs) to their agents for context-aware responses

#### Completed (2026-01-10 Morning)

**Knowledge Source Types - All Working:**
- [x] **Paste Text**: Users can paste text content directly (e.g., employee handbooks, FAQs)
- [x] **Upload File**: Support for PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX, CSV (max 10MB each)
- [x] **Add URL**: Fetch and index content from web pages

**Database Migrations:**
- [x] Created `20260109_0001` - Added `selected_tools` column to agent_components
- [x] Created `20260110_0001` - Added `knowledge_source_ids` column to agent_components

**Knowledge Search Tool:**
- [x] Created `KnowledgeRetrieverComponent` - Custom Langflow component for keyword-based search
- [x] Implemented keyword matching with relevance scoring
- [x] Content chunking with paragraph/sentence splitting
- [x] Tool properly injected into agent workflows

**RAG Fallback System:**
- [x] Implemented graceful fallback when Langflow-native RAG ingestion fails
- [x] System falls back to keyword-based search automatically
- [x] User experience unaffected - agents still work with knowledge sources

**E2E Testing:**
- [x] Created comprehensive `rag-integration.spec.ts` test
- [x] Tested all three knowledge source types via Playwright MCP
- [x] Verified chat responses use knowledge content correctly

**Files Created:**
- `src/backend/templates/tools/knowledge_retriever.json` - Knowledge search tool component
- `src/backend/templates/rag/ingest_documents.json` - RAG ingestion flow template
- `src/backend/templates/rag_agent.json` - RAG agent flow template
- `src/backend/alembic/versions/20260110_0001_add_knowledge_source_ids.py` - DB migration
- `src/frontend/e2e/tests/rag-integration.spec.ts` - E2E test for RAG workflow

**Files Modified:**
- `src/backend/app/services/workflow_service.py` - Added RAG fallback, ingestion support
- `src/backend/app/services/template_mapping.py` - Added RAG template configuration
- `src/backend/app/services/knowledge_service.py` - Added debug logging
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added chroma_data volume for vector persistence

#### Known Limitations

**RAG Ingestion Still Needs Work:**
- Langflow-native vector ingestion (Chroma + OpenAI Embeddings) fails with template validation errors
- The ingestion flow template format doesn't match Langflow's expected component structure exactly
- Current workaround: Automatic fallback to keyword-based search (works reliably)

**Future Improvements (Post-MVP):**
- [ ] Fix RAG ingestion flow template to match Langflow's exact format
- [ ] Enable true vector/semantic search via Chroma
- [ ] Add embedding model selection (OpenAI, Ollama)
- [ ] Add chunk size/overlap configuration options

#### Test Results (All Passing)

| Knowledge Source | Test | Result |
|------------------|------|--------|
| Paste Text | PTO query → "20 days per year" | ✅ Correct |
| Paste Text | Office hours query → Mon-Fri 9-6 | ✅ Correct |
| Upload File | Product price query → "$299.99" | ✅ Correct |
| Upload File | Return policy query → "30 days" | ✅ Correct |
| Add URL | Moby Dick query → Found content | ✅ Correct |
| Add URL | Author query → "Herman Melville" | ✅ Correct |

### Phase 11d: Configuration Management & Local Dev Nginx Setup ✅ Complete

**Goal**: Fix configuration management issues and enable nginx proxy for local development

#### Completed (2026-01-09 Afternoon)

**Configuration Management Fixes:**
- [x] Fixed Langflow container name mismatch (`langflow` vs `teachcharlie-langflow`)
- [x] Created single source of truth pattern: `.env` → `config.py` → services
- [x] Added `LANGFLOW_CONTAINER_NAME` to `.env.example` and `config.py`
- [x] Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use `${LANGFLOW_CONTAINER_NAME:-teachcharlie-langflow}`
- [x] Updated `langflow_service.py` to use centralized config instead of hardcoded values
- [x] Added startup validation to check container exists (warns early on misconfiguration)

**Local Development Nginx Setup:**
- [x] Created `nginx/nginx.dev.conf` - simplified nginx config for local dev (Langflow proxy only)
- [x] Created `docker-compose.dev.yml` - lightweight compose for local dev (postgres + langflow + nginx)
- [x] nginx on port 7861 handles CSS/JS injection for white-label overlay
- [x] Frontend/backend run on host machine, only Docker services proxied

**Frontend Langflow URL Fix:**
- [x] Updated `LangflowCanvasViewer.tsx` to default to port 7861 (nginx)
- [x] Canvas always goes through nginx for CSS injection (never direct to 7860)

**Documentation:**
- [x] Updated `.env.example` with local dev instructions
- [x] Documented configuration dependencies in CLAUDE.md

**Files Created:**
- `nginx/nginx.dev.conf` - Local dev nginx config
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Local dev Docker Compose

**Files Modified:**
- `.env.example` - Added LANGFLOW_CONTAINER_NAME, updated VITE_LANGFLOW_URL docs
- `src/backend/app/config.py` - Added langflow_container_name setting
- `src/backend/app/services/langflow_service.py` - Refactored to use settings
- `src/backend/app/main.py` - Added startup validation
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container name from env var, removed obsolete version
- `src/frontend/src/components/LangflowCanvasViewer.tsx` - Default to nginx port

**Local Dev Commands:**
```bash
# Start services for local development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Then run frontend and backend on host
cd src/frontend && npm run dev
cd src/backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Architecture (Local Dev):**
- Frontend: `localhost:3001` (host)
- Backend: `localhost:8000` (host)
- Langflow (via nginx): `localhost:7861` (Docker, with CSS injection)
- Langflow (direct): `localhost:7860` (Docker, no CSS)
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432` (Docker)

---

### Phase 11c: Langflow Proxy Fix & White-Label System ✅ Complete

**Goal**: Fix "Couldn't establish a connection" error in Langflow iframe and implement white-label CSS/JS injection

#### Completed (2026-01-08 Afternoon)

**Root Cause Found & Fixed:**
- [x] Diagnosed "Couldn't establish a connection" popup in Langflow canvas
- [x] Root cause: nginx `location /health` prefix match was intercepting `/health_check`
- [x] Fix: Changed to `location = /health` (exact match)
- [x] Langflow's `/health_check` endpoint now returns proper JSON: `{"status":"ok","chat":"ok","db":"ok"}`

**Nginx Configuration:**
- [x] WebSocket support with `proxy_buffering off;`
- [x] Extended timeouts (24 hours for WebSocket idle)
- [x] CSS/JS injection via `sub_filter` for white-labeling
- [x] Removed restrictive Langflow headers for iframe embedding

**White-Label System:**
- [x] `nginx/overlay/style.css` - Hides Langflow branding (header, social links, logos)
- [x] `nginx/overlay/script.js` - Hides branding text in navigation
- [x] Preserved all functional UI (Playground, Logs, Settings dialogs)

**Documentation:**
- [x] Created `docs/LANGFLOW_PROXY_FIX.md` - Comprehensive debugging guide
- [x] Updated `docs/02_CHANGELOG.md` with entry

**Files Modified:**
- `nginx/nginx.conf` - Fixed exact match for `/health`, WebSocket config
- `nginx/overlay/style.css` - White-label CSS (branding only)
- `nginx/overlay/script.js` - White-label script (branding text only)

**Files Created:**
- `docs/LANGFLOW_PROXY_FIX.md` - Connection error resolution guide

**Key Lessons:**
- Nginx location matching is prefix-based by default; use `= /path` for exact matches
- Always compare direct vs proxied responses when debugging proxy issues
- Langflow's `/health_check` endpoint returns JSON that the frontend parses

### Phase 11b: EditAgentPage Redesign & Avatar Fixes ✅ Complete

**Goal**: Redesign EditAgentPage with proper action buttons and fix avatar display/generation issues

#### Completed (2026-01-08 Morning)

**EditAgentPage UI Redesign:**
- [x] Added "Talk to Agent" button in header (links to playground)

- [x] Created footer with three action buttons:
  - Save Draft (stays on page, shows success message)
  - Publish / Publish Updates (shows restart modal)
  - Create New Workflow (disabled until published & restarted)
- [x] Removed duplicate Advanced Settings section from bottom
- [x] Added restart modal after publishing (restart now/later options)
- [x] Create New Workflow uses internal route `/canvas/:agentId`

**Behavior Fixes:**
- [x] Save Draft no longer navigates to playground
- [x] Publish no longer navigates away, shows feedback message
- [x] Publish button text changes to "Publish Updates" after initial publish
- [x] PlaygroundPage back button now goes to Edit Agent page

**Avatar Fixes:**
- [x] Avatar images in ProjectDetailPage cards display at 150% scale
- [x] Added OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to backend container
- [x] Fixed static files path in main.py
- [x] Added avatar-generation.spec.ts E2E test

## Git Status (2026-01-08)

Recent commits:
- `29c066b` - feat: EditAgentPage redesign with header/footer actions & avatar fixes
- `621855e` - feat: Phase 9 & 10 - Three-tab architecture and Avatar V2
- `7898e8a` - docs: Add Phase 3 dynamic component generation implementation guide
- `36b0dd5` - docs: Add detailed technical clarification and example walkthrough

All changes committed and pushed to origin/main.

## Known Issues

1. **Legacy agents tab**: The Agents tab shows old agents from legacy `agents` table
   - New agents created via wizard go to Workflows tab (as AgentComponent + Workflow)
   - Legacy agents still work via `/playground/:agentId`
   - Optional: Data migration script to convert legacy agents

2. **MCP servers not synced**: Creating MCP server in UI doesn't sync to `.mcp.json`

3. ~~**Publish not implemented**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** (Phase 11): Agent publish generates Python components and appears in Langflow sidebar

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Production Deploy** (Next)
   - Test in production environment
   - Verify Langflow integration

2. **Data Migration** (Optional)
   - Script to split existing legacy agents into AgentComponent + Workflow
   - Or: Continue with dual support (legacy + new)

3. **MCP Integration** (Post-MVP)
   - Implement `.mcp.json` sync
   - Implement Langflow restart mechanism

---

**Status Summary**: ✅ Green - Phase 12 complete. Knowledge sources (text, file, URL) working with keyword-based search. RAG vector ingestion needs refinement but has graceful fallback. All 3 knowledge source types tested and passing. Ready for production deploy.
